Do you think they will fall for it??\n\n\u2705 If you loved this video, don't forget to follow us on INSTAGRAM! http://www.instagram.com/brooklynandbailey\n\nWe told all of our friends that we needed them to help us film a video all about making friends in #college, but little did they know...we were about to trick them! We set the whole thing up to look like they were just going to be filming a video with me (Brooklyn), because Bailey was \u201cat a meeting\u201d. \ud83d\ude02 \n\nBailey was hiding out in the bathroom as I started the video, and a couple of minutes in, I went back to the bathroom and we SWITCHED PLACES! We went all out too, I even gave her all of my jewelry AND she wore hair extensions to look as much like me as possible\u2026 It was kind of scary how much she looked like me!! \ud83d\ude02 what do you think???\n\nWe even asked Asa (Bailey\u2019s #boyfriend) to be a part of it, and y\u2019all will never believe what happened during the video with him\u2026 \ud83d\ude48We were so laughing SO HARD!!\n\nYou can\u2019t help but feel so bad for him\u2026 but don\u2019t blame Asa for not noticing, he got Bailey back a few days later and she didn\u2019t notice he switched with one of our friends who looks a lot like him, during a photo shoot! What can they say???

                        "description": "In today\u2019s video, you\u2019ll watch us #SWITCHPLACES and try to trick our friends, including Bailey\u2019s boyfriend, Asa! Do you think they will fall for it??\n\n\u2705 If you loved this video, don't forget to follow us on INSTAGRAM! http://www.instagram.com/brooklynandbailey\n\nWe told all of our friends that we needed them to help us film a video all about making friends in #college, but little did they know...we were about to trick them! We set the whole thing up to look like they were just going to be filming a video with me (Brooklyn), because Bailey was \u201cat a meeting\u201d. \ud83d\ude02 \n\nBailey was hiding out in the bathroom as I started the video, and a couple of minutes in, I went back to the bathroom and we SWITCHED PLACES! We went all out too, I even gave her all of my jewelry AND she wore hair extensions to look as much like me as possible\u2026 It was kind of scary how much she looked like me!! \ud83d\ude02 what do you think???\n\nWe even asked Asa (Bailey\u2019s #boyfriend) to be a part of it, and y\u2019all will never believe what happened during the video with him\u2026 \ud83d\ude48We were so laughing SO HARD!!\n\nYou can\u2019t help but feel so bad for him\u2026 but don\u2019t blame Asa for not noticing, he got Bailey back a few days later and she didn\u2019t notice he switched with one of our friends who looks a lot like him, during a photo shoot! What can they say??? They\u2019ve been dating long distance for over 2 years and don\u2019t spend a lot of time physically together!\n\nWho were you the MOST surprised by that didn\u2019t notice we switched places?

                    "description": "Today, you'll watch us go head-to-head in the #PauseChallenge! Brooklyn and I are both VERY competitive, so we were each really determined to WIN this challenge! Who do you think will win??  \ud83d\ude48\n\n\u2705 Don't forget to check out our new Brooklyn & Bailey mascara and hair / jewelry accessories!\nhttps://brooklynandbaileyshop.com\n\nBasically, this is a challenge is a current trend on YouTube (made famous by Brent Rivera, Sofie Dossi, Woody & Kleiny, Morgz, the Labrant Fam, Jake Paul, Sis vs Bro, etc) where you carry a remote around and \"PAUSE\" each other in any given scenario. That paused person has no choice but to FREEZE and funny things can happen! Of course, being competitive identical #twins, we ended up trying to get even with each other on every subsequent pause!\n\nOddly enough, there was a lot of water involved for us\u2026 \ud83d\ude02 I paused Brooklyn as she JUST stepped out of the shower, she spilled water all over my face as I was attempting to take a drink, and I even got her GOOD with the water hose as she just stood there! I mean, it\u2019s hot in Texas, so I feel like maybe she should be thanking me for cooling her off? What do y'all think? \ud83d\ude02\n\nI think the WORST moment to get paused is when you REALLY have to go to the bathroom! Brooklyn paused me just as I was getting up to go to the restroom, and I seriously thought I was going to burst! I just had to stand there and deal with \"the pressure\" because I\u2019m not a quitter! (I, of course, got her back though... don\u2019t you worry!)\n\nI feel like the only question now is... who do YOU think won this Pause Challenge?? Brooklyn or Bailey?

                        "description": "Today, you'll watch us go head-to-head in the #PauseChallenge! Brooklyn and I are both VERY competitive, so we were each really determined to WIN this challenge! Who do you think will win??  \ud83d\ude48\n\n\u2705 Don't forget to check out our new Brooklyn & Bailey mascara and hair / jewelry accessories!\nhttps://brooklynandbaileyshop.com\n\nBasically, this is a challenge is a current trend on YouTube (made famous by Brent Rivera, Sofie Dossi, Woody & Kleiny, Morgz, the Labrant Fam, Jake Paul, Sis vs Bro, etc) where you carry a remote around and \"PAUSE\" each other in any given scenario. That paused person has no choice but to FREEZE and funny things can happen! Of course, being competitive identical #twins, we ended up trying to get even with each other on every subsequent pause!\n\nOddly enough, there was a lot of water involved for us\u2026 \ud83d\ude02 I paused Brooklyn as she JUST stepped out of the shower, she spilled water all over my face as I was attempting to take a drink, and I even got her GOOD with the water hose as she just stood there! I mean, it\u2019s hot in Texas, so I feel like maybe she should be thanking me for cooling her off? What do y'all think? \ud83d\ude02\n\nI think the WORST moment to get paused is when you REALLY have to go to the bathroom! Brooklyn paused me just as I was getting up to go to the restroom, and I seriously thought I was going to burst! I just had to stand there and deal with \"the pressure\" because I\u2019m not a quitter! (I, of course, got her back though... don\u2019t you worry!)\n\nI feel like the only question now is... who do YOU think won this Pause Challenge?? Brooklyn or Bailey? Comment below! \n\nThis video was just as fun to film as our recent Twin Swap videos.

                    "description": "Today we\u2019re going to see if it\u2019s possible to sell our #bad #art on #eBay! We came across a TikTok recently where a guy posted a pretty bad piece of art on eBay, but due to his strategy and how he described it, it sold for THOUSANDS of dollars! Do you think we will get any bids?? \ud83c\udfa8\n\n\u2705 Check out all of our NEW APPAREL, mascara, jewelry, hair accessories, and MORE! https://brooklynandbaileyshop.com/\n\nOf course, we had to turn this into a competition between the two of us, our younger sister @KamriNoel, and Bailey\u2019s boyfriend, Asa! We each created our own paintings and came up with different strategies on how we should market them on eBay! \n\nAll of our paintings ended up getting some SERIOUSLY high bids! Mine (Brooklyn) actually ended up getting the highest bid, and it was $15,100.00! Asa came in second place with a bid for $13,200.00, Kamri came in third place with a bid of $12,100.00, and last was Bailey\u2019s bid for $10,800.00!\n\nGoing into the competition, we didn\u2019t know if we would even get any bids at all. We agreed from the start though that if we did get any, we would be donating most of the money to a good cause. In the end, the bidders ended up not paying - so none of us made any money on our paintings this time! It was still incredibly fun to do though, and it was honestly a really cool experiment! \n\n\u2705Don\u2019t forget to follow us on TikTok to see the video that we made! https://www.tiktok.com/@brooklynandbailey?lang=en\n\n\nWhich painting was your favorite?? Comment below! \n\nThis video was just as fun to film as our recent Twin Swap videos.

                        "description": "Today we\u2019re going to see if it\u2019s possible to sell our #bad #art on #eBay! We came across a TikTok recently where a guy posted a pretty bad piece of art on eBay, but due to his strategy and how he described it, it sold for THOUSANDS of dollars! Do you think we will get any bids?? \ud83c\udfa8\n\n\u2705 Check out all of our NEW APPAREL, mascara, jewelry, hair accessories, and MORE! https://brooklynandbaileyshop.com/\n\nOf course, we had to turn this into a competition between the two of us, our younger sister @KamriNoel, and Bailey\u2019s boyfriend, Asa! We each created our own paintings and came up with different strategies on how we should market them on eBay! \n\nAll of our paintings ended up getting some SERIOUSLY high bids! Mine (Brooklyn) actually ended up getting the highest bid, and it was $15,100.00! Asa came in second place with a bid for $13,200.00, Kamri came in third place with a bid of $12,100.00, and last was Bailey\u2019s bid for $10,800.00!\n\nGoing into the competition, we didn\u2019t know if we would even get any bids at all. We agreed from the start though that if we did get any, we would be donating most of the money to a good cause. In the end, the bidders ended up not paying - so none of us made any money on our paintings this time! It was still incredibly fun to do though, and it was honestly a really cool experiment! \n\n\u2705Don\u2019t forget to follow us on TikTok to see the video that we made! https://www.tiktok.com/@brooklynandbailey?lang=en\n\n\nWhich painting was your favorite?? Comment below! \n\nThis video was just as fun to film as our recent Twin Swap videos.

How do you think we did??? (Special thanks to TheRealReal for partnering with us on this fun video!)\n\n\ud83d\udc49\ud83c\udffb Click HERE for $25 OFF your first order from TheRealReal: http://bit.ly/2NqbM5w \n\nWe\u2019ve wanted to do a fun #challenge video like this for awhile now, after being such fans of Niki & Gabi over the years! We think it\u2019s awesome to watch when they dress up as celebs in public, so we wanted to see if we could pull it off as well as they do! You can watch their amazing videos here: http://www.youtube.com/nikiandgabi\n\nFor this challenge, we dressed up as Taylor Swift, Miley Cyrus, Kylie Jenner, Ariana Grande, Billie Eilish, and Millie Bobby Brown while on Baylor's #College campus! These outfits were seriously so fun to dress up in! I think because the looks are so extreme, it really forced us outside of our comfort zone! Thanks to TheRealReal, we were able to find some really fun items to wear, to help us complete the looks! We found super cool thigh-high boots that we wore for both Miley Cyrus and Ariana Grande! We even found a super cool Gucci belt that paired up super well with the Miley Cyrus look. I think this video was even more fun for us because we generally don\u2019t get wear many designer brands (due to expense), but TheRealReal made them so much more affordable! We purposefully chose to dress up as celebrities who have very unique styles, so that people around us would recognize who we were! We definitely had a lot of looks and double-takes as we walked around!\n\nWhich celebrity look from this video was your favorite??

How do you think we did??? (Special thanks to TheRealReal for partnering with us on this fun video!)\n\n\ud83d\udc49\ud83c\udffb Click HERE for $25 OFF your first order from TheRealReal: http://bit.ly/2NqbM5w \n\nWe\u2019ve wanted to do a fun #challenge video like this for awhile now, after being such fans of Niki & Gabi over the years! We think it\u2019s awesome to watch when they dress up as celebs in public, so we wanted to see if we could pull it off as well as they do! You can watch their amazing videos here: http://www.youtube.com/nikiandgabi\n\nFor this challenge, we dressed up as Taylor Swift, Miley Cyrus, Kylie Jenner, Ariana Grande, Billie Eilish, and Millie Bobby Brown while on Baylor's #College campus! These outfits were seriously so fun to dress up in! I think because the looks are so extreme, it really forced us outside of our comfort zone! Thanks to TheRealReal, we were able to find some really fun items to wear, to help us complete the looks! We found super cool thigh-high boots that we wore for both Miley Cyrus and Ariana Grande! We even found a super cool Gucci belt that paired up super well with the Miley Cyrus look. I think this video was even more fun for us because we generally don\u2019t get wear many designer brands (due to expense), but TheRealReal made them so much more affordable! We purposefully chose to dress up as celebrities who have very unique styles, so that people around us would recognize who we were! We definitely had a lot of looks and double-takes as we walked around!\n\nWhich celebrity look from this video was your favorite??
