None of these jeans are selvedge, but they are both raw which is fun! We'll be comparing toughness, how your butt looks, construction, denim weight, bar tacks, rivets, the whole nine yards.

Well my friend, that is a tale as old as time. Today we are comparing the Wrangler Cowboy Cut 13MWZ jean to Levi's 501's rinsed and STF (shrink to fit). None of these jeans are selvedge, but they are both raw which is fun! We'll be comparing toughness, how your butt looks, construction, denim weight, bar tacks, rivets, the whole nine yards. We'll also of course be looking at fit. Thanks EdgyAlbert for inventing jeans.\n\nBye.\n\nCan I interest you in a hot bowl of following ME and The Snail in other places??\n- The Iron Snail Clothing Website: https://theironsnail.us\n- The Iron Snail Clothing Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/theironsnail\n- My Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/michaelkristy_\n- My Other Channel:    \n\n / @michaelkristy1868  \n- Need to reach out to me outside of Youtube? \ninfo@theironsnail.us\n#theironsnail\n\nThe Iron Snail is a men\u2019s fashion vlog starring a young man named Michael and featuring a snail no bigger than a quarter.

I believe you can make your home beautiful on a thrifty budget! I will take you on so many thrift with me shopping trips, share my thrift hauls and almost always show you how to use thrift finds in your home. I post every Friday and sometimes on Tuesday. Occasionally I do thrift flips and decorating videos too! I hope you walk away from my channel  feeling inspired to shop secondhand.

I will take you on so many thrift with me shopping trips, share my thrift hauls and almost always show you how to use thrift finds in your home. I post every Friday and sometimes on Tuesday. Occasionally I do thrift flips and decorating videos too! I hope you walk away from my channel  feeling inspired to shop secondhand.

                    "description": "Check out my sponsor Brilliant, free for 30 days by using this link: https://brilliant.org/nighthawk\nIn this video we explore new methods of making cutting edge radiative sky cooling paint with common grocery and hardware store items. This paint when properly applied can allow for clean, electricity free air conditioning to several degrees below ambient air temperature in direct sunlight.\n\nMy previous radiative cooling paint video: https://youtu.be/N3bJnKmeNJY\nCooling paint video(s) by Tech Ingredients: https://youtu.be/5zW9_ztTiw8 & https://youtu.be/dNs_kNilSjk\n\nNightHawkInLight's super CaCO\u2083 micro-sphere pigment recipe:\n\nSodium Carbonate (washing soda) ......... 20g dissolved in 200 mL water\n\nCalcium Chloride (painter's desiccant) ... 10g dissolved in 100 mL water\n\nCitric Acid (used for canning) .................. 3g dissolved in 30 mL water\n\n1. Combine Calcium Chloride and Citric Acid solutions into one container.\n2. Adjust the temperature of the liquids to be between 10-20\u00b0C (50-70\u00b0F).\n3. Pour Calcium Chloride/Citric Acid solution into mixer and begin stirring.\n4. Pour the Sodium Carbonate solution into the mixer and begin a timer.\n5. Allow solution to mix for 1 minute.\n6. Turn off mixer and pour the liquid into a separate container.\n7. Wash the mixer with vinegar and water to prepare for the next batch.\n***Make 3 total batches following steps 1-7, each time allowing the solution to mix for 1\nminute. To save time you can make large quantities of the starting solutions all at once,\nchill all of it to 10-20\u00b0C, and then measure out enough for individual batches by volume\njust prior to mixing.\n8. Make a fourth batch, mixing for an increased time of 5 minutes.\n***Optional: Make a fifth batch at 1/3 scale, mixing for an increased time of 8-10 minutes.\n9. Allow 20-60 minutes for the pigment to settle out of all batches.\n10. Pour the water off the top of the settled pigment and refill containers with water.\n11. Repeat settling and pouring off water 1-2 more times.\n12. Cut a rectangular opening in the bottom of a disposable bread tin.\n13. Line the tin with paper towel and a sheet of white printer paper.\n14. Pour the pigment solutions into the tin, using the paper as a filter.\n15. Pour extra distilled water over the pigment to wash it.\n16. Once filtered, place the whole tin into an oven to dry at 100\u00b0C (212\u00b0F).\n17. Collect pigment, breaking up clumps in a blender if needed.\n\nThank you to everyone that supports this channel on Patreon!

                        "title": "Making Infrared Cooling Paint From Grocery Store Items (w/Novel CaCO\u2083 Microsphere Synthesis)",
                        "description": "Check out my sponsor Brilliant, free for 30 days by using this link: https://brilliant.org/nighthawk\nIn this video we explore new methods of making cutting edge radiative sky cooling paint with common grocery and hardware store items. This paint when properly applied can allow for clean, electricity free air conditioning to several degrees below ambient air temperature in direct sunlight.\n\nMy previous radiative cooling paint video: https://youtu.be/N3bJnKmeNJY\nCooling paint video(s) by Tech Ingredients: https://youtu.be/5zW9_ztTiw8 & https://youtu.be/dNs_kNilSjk\n\nNightHawkInLight's super CaCO\u2083 micro-sphere pigment recipe:\n\nSodium Carbonate (washing soda) ......... 20g dissolved in 200 mL water\n\nCalcium Chloride (painter's desiccant) ... 10g dissolved in 100 mL water\n\nCitric Acid (used for canning) .................. 3g dissolved in 30 mL water\n\n1. Combine Calcium Chloride and Citric Acid solutions into one container.\n2. Adjust the temperature of the liquids to be between 10-20\u00b0C (50-70\u00b0F).\n3. Pour Calcium Chloride/Citric Acid solution into mixer and begin stirring.\n4. Pour the Sodium Carbonate solution into the mixer and begin a timer.\n5. Allow solution to mix for 1 minute.\n6. Turn off mixer and pour the liquid into a separate container.\n7. Wash the mixer with vinegar and water to prepare for the next batch.\n***Make 3 total batches following steps 1-7, each time allowing the solution to mix for 1\nminute. To save time you can make large quantities of the starting solutions all at once,\nchill all of it to 10-20\u00b0C, and then measure out enough for individual batches by volume\njust prior to mixing.\n8. Make a fourth batch, mixing for an increased time of 5 minutes.\n***Optional: Make a fifth batch at 1/3 scale, mixing for an increased time of 8-10 minutes.\n9. Allow 20-60 minutes for the pigment to settle out of all batches.\n10. Pour the water off the top of the settled pigment and refill containers with water.\n11. Repeat settling and pouring off water 1-2 more times.\n12. Cut a rectangular opening in the bottom of a disposable bread tin.\n13. Line the tin with paper towel and a sheet of white printer paper.\n14. Pour the pigment solutions into the tin, using the paper as a filter.\n15. Pour extra distilled water over the pigment to wash it.\n16. Once filtered, place the whole tin into an oven to dry at 100\u00b0C (212\u00b0F).\n17. Collect pigment, breaking up clumps in a blender if needed.\n\nThank you to everyone that supports this channel on Patreon!

Whoops!\n\nJust as all materials have a mostly linear relationship between temperature change and length change, all materials also have a similar relationship between stress and change in length (often called strain). And this is part of the secret to continuous welded rail: restrained thermal expansion.

Put in the wine and bring it to a boil. Grate in some of the lemon zest. Put in as many chili flakes as you want and grind in some pepper. Pour in the oil.\n\nDump the mussels in the pot, stir them around, cover and let them steam for a couple minutes before you start checking on them. Cook until the mussels open up, and stop before the meats appear to shrink \u2014 maybe 5 minutes, total. While you're waiting you can cut the lemon into wedges for the table.\n\nUse a slotted spoon to fish the mussels out to a serving bowl. If you see any that didn't open, either toss those, or hold them over somewhere that's not the pot or bowl and pry them open \u2014 if they look and smell good inside, they're probably fine.\n\nTaste the broth and consider adding salt and maybe a little lemon juice. Stir in the fresh herbs at the last second and pour the broth over the mussels. To eat them, I like to pull off the top shell (the one that isn't connected to the meat) and discard; take the shell with the meat and dip it into the broth to fill it up; slurp; repeat.",

FWIW, here's how I would make bouillabaisse in broad steps:\n\n1) If you want rouille for the croutons, start with that, because the flavor improves as it sits around for awhile. Rouille is spicy aioli and aioli is garlicy mayonnaise made with olive oil, with or without egg yolk as an emulsifier. Some possible additions would be roasted red pepper, nuts, breadcrumbs, fish stock (maybe just the juice from your stew), lemon juice or vinegar, saffron, chili powder, etc. There is no one traditional recipe, so work with what you have and what you like. Just make a spicy, garlicy mayonanaise.\n\n2) To start the stew, I'd cut up some form of onion, thin slice a fennel bulb (reserving the fronds for garnish), peel and chop some garlic and get all of that softening in a pan with olive oil. In the video I diced up an artichoke heart as well, but that probably wasn't worth it. Once soft, cover with fish stock if you have it or plain water if you don't.\n\n3) If you don't have fish stock, you can just buy a cheap, whole white fish, cut off whatever good chunks of meat you can and reserve, stuff the bones and skin and head and everything into some cheese cloth along with some bay leaves and any vegetable trimmings you have, tie off the cloth and submerge it in your simmering pot. In a half hour, you'll have amazing seafood flavor and body in your stew, and you can just pull the cloth out and discard before you eat.\n\n4) I'd do all of the above before prepping fresh tomatoes, because I think it's good to preserve their freshness and put them in halfway though. If you want to take their skins off, you can put them in the simmering stew until their skins split, pull them out and then the skins should peel off easily. Chop them roughly and get them simmering with everything else. Cook until they're pretty much broken down.\n\n5) The stew is often flavored with dried orange peel, but I liked the result from using a fresh orange toward the end of cooking. Grate the zest into the stew and then squeeze in the juice. You can also add any last minute seasonings to taste at this point \u2014 I just did saffron and salt. Saffron is expensive so consider using paprika instead if you want a redder color.\n\n6) Put your reserved fish chunks and any other seafood in the stew a few minutes before you plan to eat \u2014 most fish cooks very fast. This dish is traditionally made with a massive array of different kinds of fish, but I think it's cheaper and more sustainable to focus on making a great broth and then maybe just throw in some mussels at the end \u2014 cook them until they open up.\n\n7) Slice up a baguette or some similar bread, toast the pieces under the boiler, top with rouille, and serve with the stew. Garnish with the fennel fronds.",

Cover and let sit for 20 minutes, then knead in as much additional flour as the dough will take. Cover and let rise until doubled, 1-2 hours. Divide the dough into six little balls and let proof for a half hour. \n\nFlour the dough balls and roll them out about as thin as you can, docking them with a fork if you want lots of small bubbles instead of one big one. I like to lay each one on a little slip of parchment paper, stack them, and put them in the fridge until I'm ready to grill \u2014 they're easier to handle if cold.\n\nIgnite a bunch of charcoal, put it in the grill, cover it with a bunch more unlit charcoal, and lay on the grate. If using a gas grill, just get it as hot as you can. Same if you're using your oven \u2014 ideally, use the broiler. Pierce the eggplants so they won't explode on you when they get hot, throw them on the heat, cover, and roast until almost completely incinerated \u2014 the skins should be burned to crisp and the flesh should be dark, soft and considerably shrunken. It took me about 45 minutes, but that'll vary a lot.\n\nWhile you're waiting, you can mince your garlic.\n\nPull the eggplants off, cut them open, let them steam out until you can handle them, then scoop out the flesh, keeping burned bits of skin to a minimum. Drain as much water out of the flesh as you can \u2014 I do this by squeezing it in a tea towel, but some people use a sieve, some people use a salad spinner, etc.\n\nNow you just stir in as much garlic, lemon juice, tahini, olive oil, salt, herbs and spice as tastes good to you. When adding in the tahini and olive oil, drizzle it in slowly and stir really aggressively to form an emulsion. You'll want a lot of olive oil \u2014 enough to give you mayonnaise consistency at the end.\n\nScrape down the grill grates, slap on the doughs and cook for a minute or so on each side until puffy. If you want soft bread, pull the loafs when they still look a little doughy. I like them crackery, so I let them brown a little more.\n\nRip and dip.",

To make the stock, put the bones and skin in a big pot along with an onion (cut in half), a couple carrots and a couple celery stalks. Put the uncovered pot in the oven and brown all the stuff under the broiler/grill, taking it out to stir it a few times. (You can just fry the stuff on the stovetop instead until you've got some color on everything.) \n\nGet everything fully submerged in water, cover and cook in the oven at 200\u00baF/95\u00baC overnight or up to 24 hours. If you need stock faster, do it at 400\u00baF/200\u00baC for 2-3 hours. (You could just simmer it on the stovetop instead of doing it in the oven.) Strain all the solids out of the stock and discard. If you want to clarify the stock, separate out two egg whites, beat them with a little cold water, stir them into the stock and simmer for about 10 minutes. A raft will form at the top that traps impurities \u2014 skim or strain it off. (This is also a good time to skim off fat, if you want to. I don't.)\n\nTo make the meatballs, blitz your reserved chicken meat in a food processor until just before it forms a smooth paste. (You can mince meat by hand with a knife, though it takes awhile.) Put the meat in a big mixing bowl. Crack in one egg, or put in your two reserved egg yolks if you clarified the stock. Grate in a giant pile of cheese. Pour in some breadcrumbs (I shoot for meatballs that are about 1/4 breadcrumbs by volume). Season aggressively with dried herbs and pepper. Season conservatively with salt (you can add more in a sec). Put in a handful of roughly chopped fresh herbs. Pour in a big glug of olive oil. \n\nMix everything up then cook a tiny sample to taste for seasoning (I just microwaved it). Add more salt if needed. Roll into meatballs. You can either poach them directly in the soup, or you can brown them in a pan with olive oil before putting them in. (I recommend browning them in a nonstick pan, since chicken meatballs are very delicate and likely to break if they stick.)\n\nTo finish the soup, pour the white wine into the stock, drop in the bay leaves and season it conservatively with salt. If you have a leftover cheese rind, you could put that in now to flavor the soup. Chop your remaining carrots and onion into small pieces and put them in the stock. Put in the meatballs (browned or not). Put in the pasta. Simmer the soup until the carrots and onions are soft and the meatballs are cooked through, about half an hour. (It can hold all day like this.) Eventually take out the bay leaves and the cheese rind.\n\nWhile you're simmering the soup, peel and chop the garlic, prep the greens by trimming out any tough stems and cutting the leaves into bite-size pieces. About 10  minutes before you want to eat, stir the leaves into the soup and cook until wilted but still green. If the soup needs more liquid, add some more water and/or wine. If you're not using wine, stir in a squeeze of lemon juice or a splash of vinegar. Taste the broth and add more salt or acid if it needs it. Stir in the garlic right before you want to eat. Garnish the soup with fresh herbs in the bowl. Leftovers freeze and thaw great.",

Put in the meatballs (browned or not). Put in the pasta. Simmer the soup until the carrots and onions are soft and the meatballs are cooked through, about half an hour. (It can hold all day like this.) Eventually take out the bay leaves and the cheese rind.\n\nWhile you're simmering the soup, peel and chop the garlic, prep the greens by trimming out any tough stems and cutting the leaves into bite-size pieces. About 10  minutes before you want to eat, stir the leaves into the soup and cook until wilted but still green. If the soup needs more liquid, add some more water and/or wine. If you're not using wine, stir in a squeeze of lemon juice or a splash of vinegar. Taste the broth and add more salt or acid if it needs it. Stir in the garlic right before you want to eat. Garnish the soup with fresh herbs in the bowl. Leftovers freeze and thaw great."

                    "description": "Thanks to Noom for sponsoring this video! Take their health survey to get started: http://bit.ly/noom_adamragusea\n\n***RECIPE, SERVES SIX***\n\n1 3 lb (1.36kg) beef chuck roast \n2 shallots\n2 jalape\u00f1os\nvinegar (you'll need 1-2 cups, 236-473mL)\nsugar (maybe a quarter cup, 50g)\noil\nsalt\npepper\nmustard\nsalad greens (maybe 100g per person)\n\nCut the roast into a few thick steaks (with the meat fibers running up and down instead of side to side). Just cut it into big pieces that are easy for you to handle \u2014 they'll break apart into smaller chunks as you cook. Coat them in oil and a very generous seasoning of salt and pepper \u2014 it should seem like there's a little too much salt on them.\n\nLightly brown the meat in a big pan. Pour in enough water to almost cover the meat, cover the pan with a lid or foil, get the heat to a gentle simmer and cook until the meat is almost falling apart \u2014 I did about five hours.\n\nWhile you're waiting, you can cut the shallots and peppers into thin slices, put them in a bowl and nearly cover them with vinegar. Stir in a big handful of sugar (don't worry if it doesn't all dissolve immediately), cover and refrigerate. They'll taste like pickles in about a half hour, but longer is better \u2014 up to a week.\n\nGently fish the meat out of the pan, breaking it up as little as possible, and let the pieces dry/steam-off on paper towels for a few minutes. If there's still a lot of water in the pan, you could turn up the heat and reduce the liquid down a little bit now, but stop before it starts thickening into a glaze. Pour the liquid into a narrow vessel (a glass or measuring cup), holding back any gross chunks at the bottom of the pan.\n\nWhen the meat is dry and has stopped steaming, transfer it off the paper towels, cover it and put it into the refrigerator. Cover the liquid and refrigerate that as well. (You can do all of this first-thing the morning of dinner, or days before.) Chill until the meat is firm and the fat on top of the braising liquid has gone totally solid.\n\nWhen you're ready to actually make dinner, take the liquid out and lift the fat puck off the top. You could use that fat to re-sear the meat later, but make sure you scrape off any trace of broth or meat bits clinging to the bottom of the puck. (Any remaining water in the fat will spit as you heat it up to searing temperature.) Alternatively you could just throw the fat away, or you could melt it and use it as the oil in the salad dressing you're about to make.\n\nPour the de-fatted broth into a pan and pour in about half of the accumulated juice from your bowl of sweet pickles. Bring to a boil and reduce to a glaze, keeping in mind that it'll thicken a lot more as it cools to eating temperature. (This would be a good time to prep your salad greens.) Be sure to stir it frequently once it starts to really thicken \u2014 the sugar is liable to stick to the bottom of the pan and burn. Turn the heat off and let the glaze just sit in the warm pan until you need it.\n\nMake a vinaigrette for your salad by mixing more of your sweet pickle juice with a little mustard and however much oil you like \u2014 I do equal parts pickle juice and olive oil.\n\nIn a wide pan, heat a thick film of oil (or your rendered beef fat, assuming you got all the watery stuff scraped off of it) over moderate heat. Take your cold beef out of the fridge, tear off a little chunk and taste for seasoning. (If it seems to need more salt, you could season the pieces, or your could season the glaze.) Lay the pieces in the hot oil and brown them gently on both sides until golden and the interior of the meat feels soft and reheated. \n\nTake the pan off the heat and the meat can sit in there for a few minutes while you get your plates ready and dress your salad (if you want to dress it in advance). Plate each portion of drained meat with some salad and drained pickles. Either spoon the glaze over the meat at the last second or serve it in a little cup on the side.",

                        "description": "Thanks to Noom for sponsoring this video! Take their health survey to get started: http://bit.ly/noom_adamragusea\n\n***RECIPE, SERVES SIX***\n\n1 3 lb (1.36kg) beef chuck roast \n2 shallots\n2 jalape\u00f1os\nvinegar (you'll need 1-2 cups, 236-473mL)\nsugar (maybe a quarter cup, 50g)\noil\nsalt\npepper\nmustard\nsalad greens (maybe 100g per person)\n\nCut the roast into a few thick steaks (with the meat fibers running up and down instead of side to side). Just cut it into big pieces that are easy for you to handle \u2014 they'll break apart into smaller chunks as you cook. Coat them in oil and a very generous seasoning of salt and pepper \u2014 it should seem like there's a little too much salt on them.\n\nLightly brown the meat in a big pan. Pour in enough water to almost cover the meat, cover the pan with a lid or foil, get the heat to a gentle simmer and cook until the meat is almost falling apart \u2014 I did about five hours.\n\nWhile you're waiting, you can cut the shallots and peppers into thin slices, put them in a bowl and nearly cover them with vinegar. Stir in a big handful of sugar (don't worry if it doesn't all dissolve immediately), cover and refrigerate. They'll taste like pickles in about a half hour, but longer is better \u2014 up to a week.\n\nGently fish the meat out of the pan, breaking it up as little as possible, and let the pieces dry/steam-off on paper towels for a few minutes. If there's still a lot of water in the pan, you could turn up the heat and reduce the liquid down a little bit now, but stop before it starts thickening into a glaze. Pour the liquid into a narrow vessel (a glass or measuring cup), holding back any gross chunks at the bottom of the pan.\n\nWhen the meat is dry and has stopped steaming, transfer it off the paper towels, cover it and put it into the refrigerator. Cover the liquid and refrigerate that as well. (You can do all of this first-thing the morning of dinner, or days before.) Chill until the meat is firm and the fat on top of the braising liquid has gone totally solid.\n\nWhen you're ready to actually make dinner, take the liquid out and lift the fat puck off the top. You could use that fat to re-sear the meat later, but make sure you scrape off any trace of broth or meat bits clinging to the bottom of the puck. (Any remaining water in the fat will spit as you heat it up to searing temperature.) Alternatively you could just throw the fat away, or you could melt it and use it as the oil in the salad dressing you're about to make.\n\nPour the de-fatted broth into a pan and pour in about half of the accumulated juice from your bowl of sweet pickles. Bring to a boil and reduce to a glaze, keeping in mind that it'll thicken a lot more as it cools to eating temperature. (This would be a good time to prep your salad greens.) Be sure to stir it frequently once it starts to really thicken \u2014 the sugar is liable to stick to the bottom of the pan and burn. Turn the heat off and let the glaze just sit in the warm pan until you need it.\n\nMake a vinaigrette for your salad by mixing more of your sweet pickle juice with a little mustard and however much oil you like \u2014 I do equal parts pickle juice and olive oil.\n\nIn a wide pan, heat a thick film of oil (or your rendered beef fat, assuming you got all the watery stuff scraped off of it) over moderate heat. Take your cold beef out of the fridge, tear off a little chunk and taste for seasoning. (If it seems to need more salt, you could season the pieces, or your could season the glaze.) Lay the pieces in the hot oil and brown them gently on both sides until golden and the interior of the meat feels soft and reheated. \n\nTake the pan off the heat and the meat can sit in there for a few minutes while you get your plates ready and dress your salad (if you want to dress it in advance). Plate each portion of drained meat with some salad and drained pickles. Either spoon the glaze over the meat at the last second or serve it in a little cup on the side."

But in an inspired reversal of fortune the Billy goat has become King Billy. Soaring prices for goat meat mean clever farmers have been turning a problem into profit, and Australia has become the world\u2019s largest exporter of the product. The delicious irony though is that despite saving their bacon, most farmers can\u2019t stomach the thought of eating goat. They have remained steadfast beef and mutton men. That is until Charles Wooley introduced them to celebrity chef, Luke Mangan.\nReporter: Charles Wooley\nProducer: Nick Greenaway",

But in an inspired reversal of fortune the Billy goat has become King Billy. Soaring prices for goat meat mean clever farmers have been turning a problem into profit, and Australia has become the world\u2019s largest exporter of the product. The delicious irony though is that despite saving their bacon, most farmers can\u2019t stomach the thought of eating goat. They have remained steadfast beef and mutton men. That is until Charles Wooley introduced them to celebrity chef, Luke Mangan.\nReporter: Charles Wooley\nProducer: Nick Greenaway"
