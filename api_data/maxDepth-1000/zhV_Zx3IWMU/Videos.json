                    "description": "Say hello to the least boring summer ever! \n\nWelcome to the seventh week of camp and our seventh set of mega experiments. Be sure you\u2019re subscribed to the CrunchLabs monthly Build Box to get the most out of Camp. You can join here: https://www.crunchlabs.com/stem. Each build-it-yourself STEM toy teaches the magic and fun in engineering principles and coincides with exclusive weekly videos like this one that features mega-experiments from my special guests and me. Ready for Camp? Visit http://www.campcrunchlabs.com for more info.\n\nThis week's Challenge: MAKE A TOILET PAPER HALLWAY LASER MAZE.\nUsing toilet paper (or string or other materials), design and build your very own laser maze at home. See if your sibling or parent, or family pet can make it through unscathed. Use creativity and acrobatics to a-maze me (bad pun, sorry). Maybe the goal is to rescue a Phat Gus plushie or dive into a beanbag at the end.\nBe safe and don't forget to get permission from a parent before you create. I can't wait to watch your videos!\n\nNO PURCHASE NECESSARY. Ends 11:59 p.m. PT on 8/17/23. Open to legal residents of the 50 U.S. & D.C., 18+, who are the parent or legal guardian of a child who is between 8 and 16 years of age. GRAND PRIZE WINNER MUST TRAVEL 8/18/23-8/20/23. Visit https://www.crunchlabs.com/pages/camp-crunchlabs-contest for Official Rules including full details on eligibility requirements, how to enter, entry periods, winner selection procedure, prize descriptions and limitations. Void where prohibited. Please do not use music in your video entries!",

Be sure you\u2019re subscribed to the CrunchLabs monthly Build Box to get the most out of Camp. You can join here: https://www.crunchlabs.com/stem. Each build-it-yourself STEM toy teaches the magic and fun in engineering principles and coincides with exclusive weekly videos like this one that features mega-experiments from my special guests and me. Ready for Camp? Visit http://www.campcrunchlabs.com for more info.\n\nThis week's Challenge: MAKE A TOILET PAPER HALLWAY LASER MAZE.\nUsing toilet paper (or string or other materials), design and build your very own laser maze at home. See if your sibling or parent, or family pet can make it through unscathed. Use creativity and acrobatics to a-maze me (bad pun, sorry). Maybe the goal is to rescue a Phat Gus plushie or dive into a beanbag at the end.\nBe safe and don't forget to get permission from a parent before you create. I can't wait to watch your videos!\n\nNO PURCHASE NECESSARY. Ends 11:59 p.m. PT on 8/17/23. Open to legal residents of the 50 U.S. & D.C., 18+, who are the parent or legal guardian of a child who is between 8 and 16 years of age. GRAND PRIZE WINNER MUST TRAVEL 8/18/23-8/20/23.

You also get a closer look into the New Skull played by Andreik's older brother Aiken. \n\n#ethanfineshriber #ninjakids #ninjakidz #ninjakidstv #ninjakidztv #ninjakidspowerrangers #tommyoliver #powerrangers #greenranger #redranger #yellowranger #pinkranger #blackranger #blueranger #bulkandskull #mightymorphinpowerrangers #itsmorphintime #gogopowerrangers\n\nPatreon:\nhttps://www.patreon.com/ethanfineshriber\n\nInstagram: \n@ethanfineshriberofficial\nhttps://www.instagram.com/ethanfineshriberofficial/\nhttps://www.instagram.com/ata_ambassador_ethan/\n\nFacebook:\nEthan Fineshriber\nhttps://www.facebook.com/ethanfineshriber/\n\nTwitter: \nEFineshriber\nhttps://twitter.com/efineshriber?lang=en\n\nSnapchat: Efineshriber\n\nMusical.ly: efineshriber\n\nNinja Kidz TV YouTube channel:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCpZ88DWlKW0H_AYDaUZptcw\n\nBryton Myler's Channel\"\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCfiWa7d6um8dAb9hSz2UD-w\n\n\nTrack; Ravenface - Fighters\nMusic provided by FlyingTunes\nWatch; https://youtu.be/cU4IbxkJhrE\n\n\nTrack; We Are The Empty - Alone In The Snow\nMusic provided by FlyingTunes\nWatch; https://youtu.be/HJSdDg01_zU\n\nTrack; Dark Signal - Drag Me To Hell\nMusic provided by FlyingTunes\nWatch; https://youtu.be/eGIaKYLGb3s\n\n\nWe Are One by Vexento https://www.youtube.com/user/Vexento\nhttps://soundcloud.com/vexento\nMusic promoted by Audio Library https://youtu.be/Ssvu2yncgWU\nTitle: We Are One\nArtist: Vexento\nGenre: Dance & Electronic\nMood: Bright\nDownload: https://goo.gl/xIajyy\n\nGood For You by THBD https://soundcloud.com/thbdsultan\nCreative Commons \u2014 Attribution 3.0 Unported\u2014 CC BY 3.0 \nhttp://creativecommons.org/licenses/b...\nMusic promoted by Audio Library https://youtu.be/-K_YSjqKgvQ"

Despite her good intentions, Ellie continues to cause chaos at Uncle Jim's store and the post office, using the wrong attachments for her crane. In each scenario, Ellie tries to help but ends up creating more mess, much to everyone's dismay.\n\nHowever, things take a turn when Uncle Roy helps Ellie understand the importance of using the right tools for the job. He explains how each attachment has a specific purpose, like a wrecking ball for demolition and a claw for grabbing things. With this new knowledge, Ellie successfully helps Uncle Roy lift a heavy box with the correct crane hook.\n\nEmpowered by her newfound understanding, Ellie revisits her previous messes. She astounds Uncle Jim by expertly stacking cans at his store and amazes Charlotte by helping rebuild the Lego tower more efficiently.

Curious and unruly Messy with his best friends Zoe & Felix bring science to life through their escapades in the extraordinary world of OKIDO. Why is the sky blue? Where does honey come from? How do pictures get into the TV?  Together they fly to distant planets, shrink down to the size of pixels, and jump into a dream! The brave trio go on journeys of discovery, and - with help from Zim, Zam, & Zoom - find the answers to their big questions. The show puts fun and creativity at the heart of learning about science through stories, comedy, and adventure.\n\nMORE Messy Goes To Okido Season 3 Full Episodes \u27a4\nhttps://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLVbCoy12PNVkmWw_byYsDqt5wtnnYqaLU\n\nMORE Messy Goes To Okido Season 1 Full Episodes \u27a4\nhttps://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLVbCoy12PNVnlE1HIJ0zqt43uHutJZ8HU\n\n\ud83d\udea8NEW TVOkids Shows! \nPAW PATROL Season 10 \ud83d\udc36\nhttps://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLNvCzm3VKwPcJip2nzOoHGJddglfL73O1\nRILEY ROCKET \ud83c\udfb8 \nhttps://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLVbCoy12PNVkMRjegXG9BXpeYVK54Ze-c\nGALAPAGOS X \ud83d\udc26\nhttps://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLVbCoy12PNVkq-DtY8O_HfEJvImaegTu6\nGAME CATCHERS \ud83d\udd79\ufe0f\nhttps://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLcnbVz-1b_hruTnQvsEylNovoME1f9wa4\nMOLLY OF DENALI \u2728\nhttps://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLVbCoy12PNVnNZHWASrauvlNyc3KMLujN\nGREEN SQUAD \ud83c\udf31\nhttps://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLVbCoy12PNVlmPUeCzfSqMazgOYBHI79B\nSUNNY\u2019S QUEST Season 2 \u2600\ufe0f\nhttps://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLVbCoy12PNVl0P_3FT5qtZLG-CzR3n34n\n\n\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\udcfa POPULAR TVOkids Shows \ud83d\udcfa\ud83d\ude02\nARTHUR \ud83d\udc53 \nhttps://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLVbCoy12PNVkkCuGvrSy2js1SZLVXqF0q\nCLIFFORD \ud83d\udc36 \nhttps://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLVbCoy12PNVl9mwVb4K0ljh9ckJTVAs7_\nWILD KRATTS \ud83e\udd8a\nhttps://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLVbCoy12PNVlfBincq581d656YN3Rbmy8t\nALL-ROUND CHAMPION Season 5 \ud83c\udfc5 \nhttps://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLVbCoy12PNVk3kaDXE-szlSBYJ1BuV1T-\nSCIENCE MAX \ud83e\uddea\nhttps://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLVbCoy12PNVnopj7LrPiMgcVeIg3qgSSc\nODD SQUAD Mobile Unit \ud83e\uddee \nhttps://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLVbCoy12PNVl-1WosxbwR7nJwGcChk-0p\nKANGAROO BEACH \ud83e\udd98\nhttps://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLVbCoy12PNVkiKhUbDqpTnFV1Ozm0wa9o\nMESSY GOES TO OKIDO \ud83d\udc99\nhttps://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLVbCoy12PNVnlE1HIJ0zqt43uHutJZ8HU\n\n\ud83c\udf83\ud83c\udf84TVOkids SPECIAL Playlists \ud83c\udf84\ud83c\udf83\nHALLOWEEN \ud83d\udc7b \nhttps://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLVbCoy12PNVmVOMt6agavKmDhgB-8GQEm\nCHRISTMAS & Festive Favourites \ud83c\udf81 \nhttps://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLVbCoy12PNVnExHQULAhIZbj_EnhN9e8D\nSLIME VIDEOS \ud83c\udf75 \nhttps://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLVbCoy12PNVnDzy1jXO4Cn9Wdm_fBUYyZ\nFIRE SAFETY \ud83d\ude92 \nhttps://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLVbCoy12PNVlzvuLSznA7G4zDDrjkY2ig\nVALENTINE\u2019S DAY \ud83d\udc97 \nhttps://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLVbCoy12PNVkE5NWhywplfGLDU7N0zYFi\nBACK TO SCHOOL \ud83c\udf92 \nhttps://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLVbCoy12PNVkJvo7fiQ-D_Db7gaC5f9S0\n\nSubscribe to TVOkids Preschool on YouTube \u27a4\nhttps://www.youtube.com/c/TVOkidsPreschool?sub_confirmation=1 \nSubscribe to TVOkids on YouTube \u27a4\nhttps://www.youtube.com/c/TVOkids?sub_confirmation=1 \nSubscribe to TVOkids on YouTube Kids \u27a4 \nhttps://www.youtubekids.com/channel/UCGPPdIn67ZCLhhHABoQpNUw \nSubscribe to TVOkids PAW PATROL \u27a4\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCvh1WRSaV66pRnkHMf0by_g\n \nFollow TVOkids \u2705\nInstagram \u27a4 @tvokids\nFacebook \u27a4 https://www.facebook.com/TVOkids \nWebsite \u27a4 https://www.tvokids.com \n \nTVOkids on Smart TV \ud83d\udcfa\nAmazon Fire TV \u27a4  https://www.amazon.ca/TVO-TVOkids/dp/B09MZF9J9Y/ref=sr_1_1 \nAndroid \u27a4 https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.tvokids.tvokids \nApple\u202fTV \u27a4 https://apps.apple.com/ca/app/tvokids/id1589482498 \nLG \u27a4 https://ca.lgappstv.com/main/tvapp/detail?appId=1125313&catCode1=&moreYn=N&cateYn=N&orderType=0&headerName=&appRankCode=&sellrUsrNo= \nRoku \u27a4 https://channelstore.roku.com/en-ca/details/9567918e5458dd2bebbe69452e71c649/tvokids\n \nSubscribe to the TVOkids Newsletter\ud83d\udcf0\nhttps://www.tvokids.com/newsletter \n \nAbout TVOkids:\nTVOkids provides safe and fun learning experiences that help prepare children for school and life.

In a few episodes, curriculum expectations from Patterning and Algebra, Geometry and Spatial Sense and Probability will be included. As well, mathematics used in the series are suitable for young children in situations where they may have a need for alternative lessons/activities. In addition to the specific curriculum expectations, mathematical processes are also addressed in the series. These would mostly include problem solving, reasoning and proving, selecting computational tools and strategies, communicating, representing and connecting. The show aims at problem solving and thinking and includes building procedural fluency as well as building conceptual understanding. The show uses creativity and imagination to foster inquiry and math-talk."

In a few episodes, curriculum expectations from Patterning and Algebra, Geometry and Spatial Sense and Probability will be included. As well, mathematics used in the series are suitable for young children in situations where they may have a need for alternative lessons/activities. In addition to the specific curriculum expectations, mathematical processes are also addressed in the series. These would mostly include problem solving, reasoning and proving, selecting computational tools and strategies, communicating, representing and connecting.

In a few episodes, curriculum expectations from Patterning and Algebra, Geometry and Spatial Sense and Probability will be included. As well, mathematics used in the series are suitable for young children in situations where they may have a need for alternative lessons/activities. In addition to the specific curriculum expectations, mathematical processes are also addressed in the series. These would mostly include problem solving, reasoning and proving, selecting computational tools and strategies, communicating, representing and connecting. The show aims at problem solving and thinking and includes building procedural fluency as well as building conceptual understanding. The show uses creativity and imagination to foster inquiry and math-talk.",

In a few episodes, curriculum expectations from Patterning and Algebra, Geometry and Spatial Sense and Probability will be included. As well, mathematics used in the series are suitable for young children in situations where they may have a need for alternative lessons/activities. In addition to the specific curriculum expectations, mathematical processes are also addressed in the series. These would mostly include problem solving, reasoning and proving, selecting computational tools and strategies, communicating, representing and connecting.

Eating plastic may lead to loss of nutrition, internal injury, intestinal blockage, starvation, and even death. We know that ingested plastic is harmful to animals, and research is still being conducted to figure out all the effects, especially to communities and wild populations.\n\n#plastic #plasticpollution #microplastics #drbinocsshow #peekabookidz #plasticbag \n\nMake sure you watch the whole video to know all the answers to your curious questions! \n\nLeave your ideas, suggestions and questions for Dr. Binocs at this Email Id: peekabookidzfeedback@gmail.com\n\nFor more fun learning videos SUBSCRIBE to Peekaboo Kidz: http://bit.ly/SubscribeTo-Peekabookidz\n\nCredits - \nCopyrights and Publishing: Rajshri Entertainment Private Limited \nAll rights reserved \n\nWhat Causes Plastic Pollution - https://youtu.be/ODni_Bey154\n\nCatch Dr.Binocs At - https://goo.gl/SXhLmc\r\n\r\nTo Watch More Popular Nursery Rhymes Go To - https://goo.gl/CV0Xoo\r\n\r\nTo Watch Alphabet Rhymes Go To - https://goo.gl/qmIRLv\r\n\r\nTo Watch Compilations Go To - https://goo.gl/nW3kw9\r\n\r\nCatch More Lyricals At - https://goo.gl/A7kEmO\r\n\r\nSubscribe to Peekaboo Kidz: http://bit.ly/peekabookidz\r\n\r\nLike our Facebook page: https://www.facebook.com/peekabootv"

We played the ULTIMATE game of hide and seek with all of my friends and family! We had a huge house all to ourselves so we had a ton of great hiding spots! Of course dad was the first finder so I tried to hide on top of the biggest bunk bed in the house, but somehow he still found me first! After dad found me I got to help him look for more people. I found Mom and Navey hiding in the pantry, and I found my friend Alli hiding in the kitchen. After we found everybody it was my turn to find people, but while we were looking around we saw a HUGE SPIDER on the ceiling! We were all so scared of it and needed dads help getting rid of it but we couldn't find him! We finally found dad hiding in the game room downstairs, and he helped get the spider back with his spider family! I had SO much fun playing hide and seek in the big house, there were so many good hiding spots! Mom and Dad hid on the roof, Nick tried hiding by the indoor slide, and Niko hid under a pile of pillows! I can't wait to play hide and seek with all of my friends again!\n\nmy last video - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LfCQLT8cNt8\n\nmy dad's last video - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vHZ7xJy5WJk\n\n\nBye vlog *pshhhhh*",

Mom, Niko, and I are going into the hotel business together!! We built it from the ground up!

My Dad plays as a traveler coming off the plane from Hawaii and he needs a good place to stay! We check him in with a lot of questions and inform him that we don't allow pets in our establishment! Before he can pick a room we must give him the grand tour to let him decide where to settle in! We show him the master suite, the laundry room, the dinosaur and horse room, the linen room, the baby brother room, and the pink room!! He chose the pink room!! After he got settled in, he got ready for the spa!! Our spa was built in our bathroom! We filled the bathtub full of orbeez for a relaxing experience! We got dad to the spa and we kind of pushed him in! Then we played in the spa for a while!!

We're old grannies and we want to go shopping! We have saved up a lot of money and we want to buy a lot of things! One of our favorite stores is Brad's Super Cool Store!! It has the best stuff! It has Knick-knacks, afghans, warm clothes, a tea set, unicorns, A for Adley merch, laptops, and food for my cats!! Brad runs the store and he was super helpful!! He could shave his face though!! We walked around the store looking for the best presents for our granddaughters but we were messing with Brad instead! It was so fun to troll him for a little bit! We shopped till we dropped... literally! We were shopping so long that we fell asleep!! It as a crazy adventure!! After a long time shopping for the perfect groceries, we decided that we were going to buy the whole store like Mr Beast! It was so fun playing like we were grannies!!

We're old grannies and we want to go shopping! We have saved up a lot of money and we want to buy a lot of things! One of our favorite stores is Brad's Super Cool Store!! It has the best stuff! It has Knick-knacks, afghans, warm clothes, a tea set, unicorns, A for Adley merch, laptops, and food for my cats!! Brad runs the store and he was super helpful!! He could shave his face though!! We walked around the store looking for the best presents for our granddaughters but we were messing with Brad instead! It was so fun to troll him for a little bit! We shopped till we dropped... literally! We were shopping so long that we fell asleep!! It as a crazy adventure!! After a long time shopping for the perfect groceries, we decided that we were going to buy the whole store like Mr Beast! It was so fun playing like we were grannies!! I can't wait to do it again!!\n\nmy last video - SNOWBOARD with Adley & Dad!!

For the past few days our family has been in Belize and it has been SOO much fun! We've done so many fun things like swimming with sharks, snorkeling, and playing on the beach! We've even made some Belize buddies and we gave them some cool A for Adley merch from our Winter Workshop! Anyways, it was time to fly home and I was sad that our fun vacation was over! On our way home we had to take an airplane to Colorado so that we could get on a different airplane that would take us back home.. but we missed our flight so now we are stuck in Colorado for the day! But instead of sitting in a boring airport for the whole day, we decided to make today fun by having a \"YES DAY\" which means the kids get to decide everything that we do today, and the parents have to say YES! The first thing we chose to do was eat some breakfast in our fancy hotel breakfast room! Me and Niko made some waffles, and we got strawberries, yogurt, and chocolate! We had to eat a lot so that we had energy for the next YES DAY activity which is..... LAVA ISLAND! We found this super fun place called Lava island that had lots of fun things to do like: Trampoline Park, a jungle gym, and ICE CREAM! First we went to the jungle gym part and climbed ALL the way to the top.. and it was big enough for Mom and Dad to come with us too! We played some play pretend games in the climbing park like Pirates and The Floor is Lava! After that we went to the foam pits to do some tricks! There was one part with a huge 15 foot drop that you could jump off of and Me and Niko decided to both be brave and do it! I even did a FRONT FLIP off of it! After we were done at the foam pits we went to the LAVA pits.. which was a giant squishy lava bag that you could jump on! Then, I found a secret glow in the dark room for us to explore.. but then we noticed there was birthday supplies everywhere, soooo I think we were at somebody else's birthday party! This has been SUCH a fun day.. but it only HALF OVER cause the next thing that the kids decide for YES DAY is...

Dad and Niko are on a MiSSiON to find a new pet!  We are on a little family vacation with LOTS of our families and kids from the Spacestation in a super cool house that we stayed at last year.. remember when we played Hide n Seek here?? (mollieslanding.com) Well like I said, this morning Dad and Niko woke up REALLY early to go search for bugs, lizards, animals,  and butterflies in our new neighborhood! Finding the lizards was the easy part, but catching or trapping the lizards was hard! They are just SO fast! While they were searching for lizards they found more REALLY cool things like, Dinosaur Bones, Crystals, Cactus, and even a BABY BUNNY RABBIT! SOOO CUTE!! Then they finally found the perfect lizard to catch... Dad was really sneaky and GOT IT!!  We put it in a cup and Niko named it Mr. Crowman. He was so little and adorable, so we took it back to our house to make him a lizard home with rocks, leaves, and some water! We kept him as our vacation pet for the rest of our trip, but then we had to let him go! When we were all saying goodbye he JUMPED on Niko and crawled up him like he was giving Niko a hug! Then we put him back in the wild for him to go catch bugs!\n\nour new shoes: https://kizik.com/pages/adley?utm_source=Influencer&utm_medium=YouTube&utm_campaign=Adley&utm_id=kids_launch&utm_content=Kids+Shoes\n\nmy last video - A for ADLEY Baby Day Care!!

Dad and Niko are on a MiSSiON to find a new pet!  We are on a little family vacation with LOTS of our families and kids from the Spacestation in a super cool house that we stayed at last year.. remember when we played Hide n Seek here?? (mollieslanding.com) Well like I said, this morning Dad and Niko woke up REALLY early to go search for bugs, lizards, animals,  and butterflies in our new neighborhood! Finding the lizards was the easy part, but catching or trapping the lizards was hard! They are just SO fast! While they were searching for lizards they found more REALLY cool things like, Dinosaur Bones, Crystals, Cactus, and even a BABY BUNNY RABBIT! SOOO CUTE!! Then they finally found the perfect lizard to catch... Dad was really sneaky and GOT IT!!  We put it in a cup and Niko named it Mr. Crowman. He was so little and adorable, so we took it back to our house to make him a lizard home with rocks, leaves, and some water! We kept him as our vacation pet for the rest of our trip, but then we had to let him go! When we were all saying goodbye he JUMPED on Niko and crawled up him like he was giving Niko a hug! Then we put him back in the wild for him to go catch bugs!\n\nour new shoes: https://kizik.com/pages/adley?utm_source=Influencer&utm_medium=YouTube&utm_campaign=Adley&utm_id=kids_launch&utm_content=Kids+Shoes\n\nmy last video - A for ADLEY Baby Day Care!!

We've even made some Belize buddies and we gave them some cool A for Adley comfy cozy merch from our Winter Workshop! Anyways, today we have just been taking it easy and playing in the pool! We brought some snacks, floaties, and the water vlog! Niko was showing dad all of his pool tricks like holding his breath, and doing a cannon ball into the pool to make a huge splash. While I was pretending to be an otter! Then we all started to play otters.. it's like we were a little otter family! My name was \"Lil A\" and Niko's otter name was \"Wads\" Mom was our momma otter, and Dad was our owner! We pretended that the chips and cookies that we brought to the pool were our otter \"Fish Snacks\"! After we got a treats it was time to learn some otter tricks! My first trick was doing handstands in the pool with mom!! Gymnastics in the pool is even more fun than on land! My next otter trick was learning how to do front flips and back flips under water. Then Dad found some cool shells that sink in the pool.. so we had an idea! Dad would throw the shells into the deep end of the pool, them me and mom would dive down and find them! While we were practicing our tricks Niko found a TINY LITTLE BABY CRAB! It was sooooo cute, it had tiny claws and a little shell! Niko even held it in his hand! I had so much fun playing in the pool, and I am glad you got to play otters with us by watching this video\n\nmy last video -  WiNTER WORKSHOP is BACK!! Adley & Niko made surprises for you!

For the last few days our family has been on a family vacation in Belize and it was SO much fun! We did so many fun things like swimming with sharks, snorkeling, and playing on the beach! We've even made some Belize buddies and we gave them some cool A for Adley merch from our Winter Workshop! When it was time to fly home we had to take an airplane to Colorado so that we could get on a different airplane that would take us back home.. but we missed our flight so now we are stuck in Colorado for the day! So we decided that we were going to have YES DAY which means the kids get to do anything we want and our parents have to say yes! The first thing we decided to do in Colorado was go to a place called LAVA ISLAND!! It had trampolines, foam pits, ball pits, slides, and a giant lava volcano! For part 2 of our yes day, we wanted to go to a place called Dr. Seuss Land! It was a huge building with lots of Dr Seuss characters in a bunch of different rooms! First we had to go into a balloon maze and looks for secret clues to solve the mystery puzzle. While we were in the maze we found Thing 1, Thing 2, and The Cat in the Hat! They were so nice and took a picture with us! After we found our way our of the maze, we went into another room. This time we had to find Dr. Seuss characters hidden in the room! The next room was REALLY COOL! It had a bunch of trees that look like cotton candy! Me and Niko we're small enough that we could run around under the trees and Dad couldn't find us! We even pretended that me and Niko were dad's cats that ran away and he had to come find us! Last, we had to go to the gift shop to buy a surprise for Navey when we got home! All the Dr. Seuss stuff reminded me of THE GRINCH and all the videos we did with Grinch a long time ago! So we started to watch all of our old grinch videos.. me and Niko were so small\n\nmy last video - LOST on LAVA iSLAND for 5 HOURS!! Kids Choose the Day!

Anyone can stop by and drop off their pet and we will watch them for the day!! We have beds, food, baths, and fun activities for all the pets and they have a great time with us!! We usually get the usual dogs, cats, and guinea pigs BUT today was really special!! We were visited by Little Live Pets!! We got to take care of some really cool animals like birds, turtles, and pet fish!! The birds loved to sing and repeat us, the turtles loved walking around land and swimming in water, and the fish loved to race and have fun in the pool!! I loved playing with these new toys and I can't wait to do it again!!\nThis video was sponsored by Moose Toys\n\nmy last video - KiDS Leprechaun TRAP!!

We have birds in our backyard and at Pirate Island!! We love being friends with animals so birds love building nests near us!! So I got my family together and told them that we needed to get our new friends new houses as soon as possible!! We got some really fun bird houses like a rocket, a mansion, and a pirate ship!! Mom and I took the house, Niko took the Ship, and my Dad took the rocket!! Mom and I used a whole bunch of pretty colors like yellow, red, blue, purple, and orange. We also decorated it with all sorts of designs!! Niko used ALL THE COLORS and he loved every second of it!! Dad decorated his rocket with Gold and Black to make it a Spacestation Gaming bird house and it looked so cool!! While painting I got distracted and I turned into a penguin and painted my face to look like a reindeer!! I love face paint and I love tricking my dad so I thought it was a great idea!! Once we were done painting our masterpieces we took our houses to pirate island and we introduced our houses to our bird friends!! I hope they love their new houses and I'm so excited to meet their babies!!\n\nmy last video - DAD swallowed A FLY!!

Today me, mom, and niko went to DINOSUAR TRAINING SCHOOL!! We were late to school so we raced into class and got our seats right as teacher dad was coming into the classroom. We started class today by giving our dinosaurs a drink of water. My dinosaur was SUPER thirsty and almost drank and entire water bottle. Then we had to feed our dinosaurs, it started out really good but then my dinosaur got ahold of the bag of food and started to go crazy! Then we had to give out baby dinosaurs a bath, so we got out all of the soap, water, and rags to make them super clean and ready for our next step! Then we got to PAINT our dinosaurs spikes which was sooooo fun! I was trolling the teacher the WHOLE time. I even put some paint on moms foot! Teacher dad got so made that he made us take a snack break time out. But during snack time mom and niko ran away from school! I went looking for them because they stole my chocolate chip cookies too! I found them over by the bird house that niko painted a few days ago. Then I brought them back to class and the teacher made us all get back to work! When we finished painting our dinosaurs we were all dirty, so we decided to jump into the water at pirate island! It was the perfect way to end the perfect day at dino training school!\n\nmy last video: Adley\u2019s HAiR SALON and SPA \u2702\ufe0f Dad gets a Makeover!! first haircut, shaving cream, and luxury wash!\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCMW2VwLbqs\n\nmy dad's last video: BABY BiRDS just HATCHED!!

Welcome to my pet spa & hair salon! My dad and I have been working here a while and we love it a lot!! We get a lot of different types of patients, who are mostly fun pets!! The animals come here to get groomed, washed, and to have fun!! The only problem is that we don't have the right tools but we make it work! Today was a different story!! Mom came rushing in and had Two Scruff-A-Luvs Cutie Cuts and they needed to be groomed in the worst way!! Mom says she rescued them and that they needed an owner! My dad and I jumped into action helping these Cuties!! These new friends came with their very own tools and it was so nice because it was exactly what we needed!! Their hair was overgrown but it was no match for their shavers that they came with! The hair seemed to just fall out and we gave them the perfect hair cuts! After that, we needed to give them a bath and oh boy they needed it!! We got them all washed up and then we needed to style their look! Lucky for us they came with collars, fingernail polish, bows, and combs to make them look their best!! My dad and I asked mom if we could keep these fun new friends and she said YES!! I was so excited I've always wanted my very own cutie to take care of!!\nThis video is sponsored by Moose Toys\n\nBye vlog *pshhhhh*",

I was so excited I've always wanted my very own cutie to take care of!!\nThis video is sponsored by Moose Toys\n\nBye vlog *pshhhhh*"

Today we are playing on of my favorite games, Neighborhood, but with a really fun twist! We are going to make everything MINI!! We wanted to shrink everything down so we could but a whole neighborhood in one room!! For our neighborhood, we planned to make a house, beach, park, salon, and a grocery store! To help with the store we used our new 5 Surprise Mini Mart and then we used the 5 Surprise Mini Balls to stock the shelves! Since everything was tiny we thought it would be a good idea to draw faces on our hands and use them as people for our mini world!! It was really funny! After we got our hands looking fabulous we started a new day in our pretend play world! We decided that I would run the grocery store, mom would run the accessory store, and dad would be our delivery driver!! Everyday Dad would deliver the 5 surprise mini brands to our store and we would open them up, see what's inside, stock the shelves, and then play with all of our tiny products! After every long day, my family and I would go back to the house we built and sleep so we could have the energy for the day after!\n#ad\n\n\nBye vlog *pshhhhh*",

It\u2019s been pretty fun being small!! We\u2019ve found an alien dog and now he\u2019s our pet and we love him. We have also been using 5 surprise mini brand balls to help us live!! Luckily they are filled with food and soap to help us in our little life!! When we get close to running out of essentials we run to our friend\u2019s bradd super cool store to fill up on supplies!! He helps us out with everything!! Another thing that I love to do is putting up a screen and watching adley videos like it was a movie theater!! I love being small!

Something happened to us!! We shrunk down and turned into mini monsters!! And it wasn\u2019t just us that got small, our house, grocery store, and friends all became mini too!! It\u2019s been pretty fun being small!! We\u2019ve found an alien dog and now he\u2019s our pet and we love him. We have also been using 5 surprise mini brand balls to help us live!! Luckily they are filled with food and soap to help us in our little life!! When we get close to running out of essentials we run to our friend\u2019s bradd super cool store to fill up on supplies!! He helps us out with everything!! Another thing that I love to do is putting up a screen and watching adley videos like it was a movie theater!! I love being small! You should try it sometime!!\n#ad\n\nBye vlog *pshhhhh*"

Sorry my alarm is really loud... but it's another BEAUTiFUL day in my neighborhood! The first thing I do when I wake up is take care of all my pets! I have LOTS of pets like, giraffes, bears, unicorns, bunny rabbits, and dogs! Every morning I make sure they all have food, water, and a big hug! After I did my animal check up routine I went to visit my neighbor Niko! He was sleeping so I had to wake him up! While I was talking to Niko a new person came to our neighborhood and wanted to move in! I showed him a beautiful house in the neighborhood made of sticks and flowers for him to live in, and Niko got him a job and the store down the road! After that I got on my horse and rode to my job as a vet! My first patient of the day was Niko's pet owl... he looked into the sun and hurt his eyes! Luckily it wasn't too bad and he felt better after I gave him some medicine and eye cream! My next patient was a parrot coming in for a check up! Everything looked good until I checked under it's beak! HE HAD BEAK BUGS! I tried to get them to come out but they weren't moving! So I put a birdie cone on so he wouldn't itch them and told him to come back tomorrow. The next day when I went to work my assistant was there to help! We got all the beak bugs out of the parrot and helped the zoo keeper give his lion some shots! After work I invited EVERYONE in the neighborhood to a birthday party for my pets that are twins! Everyone brought birthday presents and we had some yummy cake! Then it was time for bed, so tomorrow we could have another BEAUTiFUL day in my neighborhood!\n\nmy last video - KiDS vs ADULTS cave HiDE N SEEK!! Winners get a Backyard Pool Party!

We got them out of their shells, we put them in some water, and we helped our Scruff-A-Luvs go from Scruffy to Fluffy with their brush!! I got a little Puppy Mermaid and Niko got the Bunny Mermaid!! We were so excited to have them at our house that we decided to adopt them!! I named my new pet Grapey and Niko\u2019s bunny was named Cotton!

Today is our cleaning day! Every week we have one day that we all get together as a family and clean our house. This week is was on dusting duty, mom was sweeping the floors, and dad was cleaning the kitchen. But while we were cleaning we heard the doorbell go off, when we opened the door we had a delivery!! They were the two cutest little pet pigs. Me and Niko decided that we would be their parents and take good care of them, we named our new pets Biscuit and Dinosaur Piggy. First we had to set up a pig neighborhood inside our house for the pigs to live in. After all that hard work the baby pigs were super hungry so we fed them a bottle. Mom had a GREAT idea to set up a race!! We got our the tape and set up the DIY race track. After the race we decided to take our piggy babies to the park and play in the grass and on the trampoline. I am SOO glad we adopted our new pet pigs, we had so much fun taking care of them!! \n\nBye vlog *pshhhhh*",

Today is our cleaning day! Every week we have one day that we all get together as a family and clean our house. This week is was on dusting duty, mom was sweeping the floors, and dad was cleaning the kitchen. But while we were cleaning we heard the doorbell go off, when we opened the door we had a delivery!! They were the two cutest little pet pigs. Me and Niko decided that we would be their parents and take good care of them, we named our new pets Biscuit and Dinosaur Piggy. First we had to set up a pig neighborhood inside our house for the pigs to live in. After all that hard work the baby pigs were super hungry so we fed them a bottle. Mom had a GREAT idea to set up a race!! We got our the tape and set up the DIY race track. After the race we decided to take our piggy babies to the park and play in the grass and on the trampoline. I am SOO glad we adopted our new pet pigs, we had so much fun taking care of them!! \n\nBye vlog *pshhhhh*"

So we are going to have a party with our Barbies to celebrate. We have almost everything ready for a party in our Dream House, we got a puppy cake, a pool, and our dreamhouse is a slide mansion so we have a GiANT slide too! While we were setting up Barbie slipped at the top of the slide and hurt her ankle! We were all hoping it was just a sprain but we needed to take her to Dr. Adley to find out for sure. When they got to the doctors office our friend Niko had to fill out some papers while Barbie got an X-RAY! It turns out she did break her bone and she has to get a cast. Luckily the doctors had a bunch of stickers so she could decorate it so it looked really pretty! As soon as Barbie got back from the doc we kept on partying for Koopa!!  \n\nBye vlog *pshhhhh*",

So we are going to have a party with our Barbies to celebrate. We have almost everything ready for a party in our Dream House, we got a puppy cake, a pool, and our dreamhouse is a slide mansion so we have a GiANT slide too! While we were setting up Barbie slipped at the top of the slide and hurt her ankle! We were all hoping it was just a sprain but we needed to take her to Dr. Adley to find out for sure. When they got to the doctors office our friend Niko had to fill out some papers while Barbie got an X-RAY! It turns out she did break her bone and she has to get a cast. Luckily the doctors had a bunch of stickers so she could decorate it so it looked really pretty! As soon as Barbie got back from the doc we kept on partying for Koopa!!  \n\nBye vlog *pshhhhh*"
