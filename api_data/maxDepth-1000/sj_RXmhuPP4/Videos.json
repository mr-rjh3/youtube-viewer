The economic costs of Brexit were masked by the Covid-19 pandemic and the crisis in Ukraine. But six years after the UK voted to leave, the effect has become clear. In this film, senior FT writers and British businesspeople examine how Brexit hit the UK economy, the political conspiracy of silence, and why there has not yet been a convincing case for a 'Brexit dividend'.\n\nProduced, directed and edited by Daniel Garrahan\n\n#brexit #ukeconomy #business #EU #europeanunion #Tories #conservatives #Labour #labourparty #ukip #britain #ukpolitics #UKbusiness #liztruss #BorisJohnson #kwasikwarteng #KeirStarmer #jeremyhunt #NigelFarage #UK #unitedkingdom #news #uknews #currentaffairs #bondmarket #gilts #sterling #tradebonds #markets #financialmarkets #finance #investing  \n\n00:00 - The Brexit effect\n01:41 - The economic impact\n04:40 - Brexit and business\n09:45 - Britain falls behind\n13:45 - The labour market\n15:05 - Northern Ireland conundrum \n16:50 - The conspiracy of silence\n18:57 - Winners and losers\n21:17 - The Brexit 'dividend\n\nSee if you get the FT for free as a student (http://ft.com/schoolsarefree) or start a \u00a31 trial: https://subs.ft.com/spa3_trial?segmentId=3d4ba81b-96bb-cef0-9ece-29efd6ef2132.\r\n\r\n\u25ba Check out our Community tab for more stories on the economy.\r\n\u25ba  Listen to our podcasts: https://www.ft.com/podcasts\r\n\u25ba  Follow us on Instagram:  https://www.instagram.com/financialtimes'",

                        "description": "The UK's recent disastrous \"mini\" Budget can trace its origins back to Britain's decision to leave the European Union. The economic costs of Brexit were masked by the Covid-19 pandemic and the crisis in Ukraine. But six years after the UK voted to leave, the effect has become clear. In this film, senior FT writers and British businesspeople examine how Brexit hit the UK economy, the political conspiracy of silence, and why there has not yet been a convincing case for a 'Brexit dividend'.\n\nProduced, directed and edited by Daniel Garrahan\n\n#brexit #ukeconomy #business #EU #europeanunion #Tories #conservatives #Labour #labourparty #ukip #britain #ukpolitics #UKbusiness #liztruss #BorisJohnson #kwasikwarteng #KeirStarmer #jeremyhunt #NigelFarage #UK #unitedkingdom #news #uknews #currentaffairs #bondmarket #gilts #sterling #tradebonds #markets #financialmarkets #finance #investing  \n\n00:00 - The Brexit effect\n01:41 - The economic impact\n04:40 - Brexit and business\n09:45 - Britain falls behind\n13:45 - The labour market\n15:05 - Northern Ireland conundrum \n16:50 - The conspiracy of silence\n18:57 - Winners and losers\n21:17 - The Brexit 'dividend\n\nSee if you get the FT for free as a student (http://ft.com/schoolsarefree) or start a \u00a31 trial: https://subs.ft.com/spa3_trial?segmentId=3d4ba81b-96bb-cef0-9ece-29efd6ef2132.\r\n\r\n\u25ba Check out our Community tab for more stories on the economy.\r\n\u25ba  Listen to our podcasts: https://www.ft.com/podcasts\r\n\u25ba  Follow us on Instagram:  https://www.instagram.com/financialtimes'"

Over the past 14 years, it's become a poorer, nastier and far less hopeful place. As the country prepares to head to the polls in the 2024 general election, I thought I'd review exactly how we got here.\n\nThis is the story of how the British Conservative Party under David Cameron, Theresa May, Boris Johnson, Liz Truss and Rishi Sunak subjected the UK to a series of unhinged free-market experiments which ate away at the very foundations of British economic, social and political life.\n\nThis is the story of how Britain became a poor country.\n\nSupport my work on Patreon at https://patreon.com/tomnicholas\n\nTwitch: http://twitch.tv/tom_nicholas\nTwitter: http://twitter.com/tom_nicholas\nInstagram: http://instagram.com/tomnicholaswtf\nPatreon: http://patreon.com/tomnicholas\nWebsite: http://www.tomnicholas.com\n\nSelect footage courtesy of Getty\nMusic from Epidemic Sound"

Now he turns his attention to what he sees as a perfect storm of factors that are causing a collapse in mental health among teenagers today. According to the American College Health Association, since 2010 anxiety among American college students has increased by 134%, depression by 106%, bipolar disorder by 57%, and anorexia by 100%.  \n\nIn April 2024 Haidt came to the Intelligence Squared stage where in conversation with BBC presenter Sarah Montague he drew on his new book The Anxious Generation, which has shot to No 1 in the Sunday Times bestsellers. He argued that the decline of free play in childhood and the rise of smartphone use among adolescents are the twin sources of increased mental distress among teenagers. He showed how, between 2010 and 2015, as teens traded in their flip phones for smartphones packed with social media apps, time online soared. This profound shift took place against a backdrop of diminishing childhood freedom, as parents over-supervised every aspect of their children\u2019s lives offline, depriving them of the face-to-face experiences with their peers which they need to become strong and self-governing adults. In short, childhood got rewired.\n\nHaidt argued that it isn\u2019t too late to put the genie back in the bottle. Against the backdrop of the growing movement to ban smartphones in schools, he drew on traditional wisdom and cutting-edge research to offer practical advice to parents, teachers and teenagers,\n\n---------\n\nWant to see more videos and virtual events? \n\u2705  Subscribe to this channel and turn on notifications: https://www.youtube.com/user/iqsquared?sub_confirmation=1\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nIntelligence Squared has established itself as the leading forum for live, agenda-setting debates, talks and discussions around the world.

His work delves into the complexities of cognition, language, and social behavior, and his research offers a window into the fundamental workings of the human mind. \n\nToday, we talk to Pinker about why smart people believe stupid things, the psychology of conspiracy theories, free speech and academic freedom, why democracy and enlightenment values are contrary to human nature, the moral panic around AI, and much more."

How can a species that discovered vaccines for Covid-19 in less than a year produce so much fake news, quack cures and conspiracy theorising?\n\nFrom The Selfish Gene and The Blind Watchmaker to The Blank Slate and Enlightenment Now, Richard Dawkins and Steven Pinker have dedicated their lives to sharing their insights into what science and philosophy can tell us about human nature and the meaning and mystery of life.\n\nNow they join us to debunk the cynical clich\u00e9 that humans are an irrational species. Together, Richard and Steven will explore the powerful tools of reasoning that we have built up over millennia \u2013 and consider how rationality can lead to better choices in our lives and in the public sphere.\n\nIt\u2019s an unmissable chance to hear from two of the most iconoclastic and distinguished thinkers of our time.\n\nSteven Pinker is an experimental cognitive scientist. Currently Johnstone Professor of Psychology at Harvard, he has also taught at Stanford and MIT.

Past winners have included philosopher and cognitive scientist Daniel Dennett, activist and feminist Ayaan Hirsi Ali, and actor and writer Stephen Fry.\n\nThis event was an unscripted conversation between Gervais and Dawkins, in which everything is on the table and nothing is sacred. They were joined by host, best-selling author and professor of psychology, Richard Wiseman.",

Past winners have included philosopher and cognitive scientist Daniel Dennett, activist and feminist Ayaan Hirsi Ali, and actor and writer Stephen Fry.\n\nThis event was an unscripted conversation between Gervais and Dawkins, in which everything is on the table and nothing is sacred. They were joined by host, best-selling author and professor of psychology, Richard Wiseman."

                    "description": "On this episode of StarTalk Radio, Neil deGrasse Tyson and comic co-host Chuck Nice are answering fan-submitted Cosmic Queries with the help of theoretical physicist and author Brian Greene. Brian has been a frequent guest on StarTalk and always tends to blow our minds when he shows up \u2013 this time is no different. The topic for this episode is Until the End of Time, which also happens to be the name of Brian\u2019s new book!\n\nHow far will we journey into the cosmos during our lifetime? Neil and Brian ponder this but they also debate how long humanity will last in general. Will we outlive the predicted length of existence we\u2019ve seen from other species? Will we destroy ourselves? What happens if we send a crew into interstellar space and when they return everyone is gone? You\u2019ll learn how long it takes just to get out of the Milky Way alone and what humans would be like if they grew up never knowing the Earth. \n\nWe explore free choice and free will. Brian tells us why he thinks we don\u2019t have either. Discover more about time: is it made of something? You better believe we talk about string theory. Brian shares why spacetime itself could be stitched together by the threads of quantum entanglement. You\u2019ll hear how dark energy could rip the fabric of spacetime \u2013 and why that might not be as catastrophic as it sounds. You\u2019ll also learn why black holes shrink down if spacetime rips apart. \n\nWe dive into the meaning of life: Is there any? And, if there isn\u2019t, what\u2019s the point in living? Brian explains why he thinks physics should guide us and also set us free. Neil and Brian discuss the role of religion and if that would change if we were contacted by extraterrestrials. You\u2019ll find out where the universe ends. Lastly, we investigate entropy in the universe. All that, plus, discover more about the simulation universe and if the human brain will ever figure out human consciousness.\n\nSupport us on Patreon: https://www.patreon.com/startalkradio\n\nSubscribe to StarTalk: https://www.youtube.com/user/startalkradio?sub_confirmation=1\n\nFollow StarTalk:\nTwitter: http://twitter.com/startalkradio\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/StarTalk\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/startalkradio/\n\nAbout StarTalk: \nScience meets pop culture on StarTalk!

                        "description": "On this episode of StarTalk Radio, Neil deGrasse Tyson and comic co-host Chuck Nice are answering fan-submitted Cosmic Queries with the help of theoretical physicist and author Brian Greene. Brian has been a frequent guest on StarTalk and always tends to blow our minds when he shows up \u2013 this time is no different. The topic for this episode is Until the End of Time, which also happens to be the name of Brian\u2019s new book!\n\nHow far will we journey into the cosmos during our lifetime? Neil and Brian ponder this but they also debate how long humanity will last in general. Will we outlive the predicted length of existence we\u2019ve seen from other species? Will we destroy ourselves? What happens if we send a crew into interstellar space and when they return everyone is gone? You\u2019ll learn how long it takes just to get out of the Milky Way alone and what humans would be like if they grew up never knowing the Earth. \n\nWe explore free choice and free will. Brian tells us why he thinks we don\u2019t have either. Discover more about time: is it made of something? You better believe we talk about string theory. Brian shares why spacetime itself could be stitched together by the threads of quantum entanglement. You\u2019ll hear how dark energy could rip the fabric of spacetime \u2013 and why that might not be as catastrophic as it sounds. You\u2019ll also learn why black holes shrink down if spacetime rips apart. \n\nWe dive into the meaning of life: Is there any? And, if there isn\u2019t, what\u2019s the point in living? Brian explains why he thinks physics should guide us and also set us free. Neil and Brian discuss the role of religion and if that would change if we were contacted by extraterrestrials. You\u2019ll find out where the universe ends. Lastly, we investigate entropy in the universe. All that, plus, discover more about the simulation universe and if the human brain will ever figure out human consciousness.\n\nSupport us on Patreon: https://www.patreon.com/startalkradio\n\nSubscribe to StarTalk: https://www.youtube.com/user/startalkradio?sub_confirmation=1\n\nFollow StarTalk:\nTwitter: http://twitter.com/startalkradio\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/StarTalk\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/startalkradio/\n\nAbout StarTalk: \nScience meets pop culture on StarTalk!

Then, we investigate the Higgs boson, the Higgs field, and the Large Hadron Collider. Neil shares a helpful metaphor to understand the Higgs boson that involves a Hollywood party, Chuck, and Beyonc\u00e9. \n\nNeil and Chuck debate which is more likely to happen \u2013 extraterrestrial contact or the ability to travel through the dimensions. You\u2019ll learn more about higher dimensions and how they interact with the reality of other dimensions. We investigate the possibility of complex organisms existing in the liquid masses of our solar system, like on Enceladus or Europa. Neil gives us a lesson in thermodynamics in order to explain how life survives. \n\nLastly, you\u2019ll explore Low Earth orbit.

In this second part, we get even deeper and go even further into the mysteries of the universe. \n\nWe start with the age-old question: which came first, the chicken or the egg? Neil gives us the definitive answer. But then we expand the question even further. Which came first: space itself or the Big Bang? This inspires Chuck to come up with a word to describe \u201csomething that is nothing\u201d. You\u2019ll hear about the history of the multiverse theory. Neil tells us why Einstein\u2019s general theory of relativity and quantum mechanics don\u2019t \u201cget along\u201d. \n\nWe explore the rules of quantum mechanics. Find out if light itself can get spaghettified at the event horizon of a black hole. We discuss a simulation universe. And, if we are in a simulation universe, how would you explain the weather? Discover why everything in the universe is sphere-shaped and curvy. We ponder if the Big Bang created life itself. Neil explains why we shouldn\u2019t look for life near stars and on planets that were around towards the beginning of the universe. \n\nWe discuss dark matter. Neil gives us his thoughts on why it should be renamed to dark gravity. You\u2019ll also hear why dark matter is still the longest unsolved mystery in modern astrophysics. We explore the nature of sunlight and how it travels to the Earth, the Moon, and how it interacts with both. All that, plus, find out why time stops at the speed of light. \n\nThis episode originally aired on Jan 20, 2020.\n\nSupport us on Patreon: https://www.patreon.com/startalkradio\n\nSubscribe to StarTalk: https://www.youtube.com/user/startalkradio?sub_confirmation=1\n\nFollow StarTalk:\nTwitter: http://twitter.com/startalkradio\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/StarTalk\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/startalkradio/\n\nAbout StarTalk: \nScience meets pop culture on StarTalk!

On this episode of StarTalk Radio, Neil deGrasse Tyson and comic co-host Chuck Nice answer fan-submitted Cosmic Queries on a range of topics that stem from the deepest thoughts, ideas, and feelings we share about our place in the universe.\n*Segment timecodes at bottom of description!* \nWhat boggles your mind? The expansion of the universe? The study of black holes? Neil explains why he\u2019s boggled by research being done in the field of neuroscience. We ponder if the human brain will ever fully figure out the human mind. We also ponder if the universe has complexities that the human mind will never comprehend. You\u2019ll learn about the minute differences between human and chimpanzee DNA and what that could mean for humans in comparison to something that could have higher intelligence than us.\n\nWe debate how long humanity will last. We investigate the consequences of humans creating an intelligence greater than our own. You\u2019ll hear why Neil has confidence humanity will last given the collective nature of our intelligence. We ask, \u201cIf the universe is under no obligation to make sense to us, why study it in the first place?\u201d Neil tells us why our five senses limit us from fully grasping certain elements and constructs of the universe \u2013 and how science picks up the slack. \n\nWe talk about the aging process and the idea of living forever. Then, we dive into the big question: what is the meaning of life? Neil shares his thoughts on how he finds meaning in his own life. You\u2019ll learn why, whenever you look out into the universe, you\u2019re looking at the past. \n\nDiscover more about the vacuum of space. We also discuss what should be the priority, or priorities, in space exploration. Lastly, you\u2019ll learn about higher dimensions and if they\u2019re bleeding into our own universe. All that, plus, find out more about the shape of space itself. \n\nThis episode originally aired as a podcast on September 27, 2019.\n\n#StarTalk #NeildeGrasseTyson #Space\n\nSegment Timecodes\n0:00 - Introduction\n3:05 - What boggles Neil's mind? \n12:30 - What is the point of science? \n18:31 - Who has a deeper voice? \n19:06 - How long will the human race survive?\n28:10 - What is the meaning of our human existence?\n33:10 - How is space a vacuum?\n39:01 - Lightning Round\n39:10 - What should be our priority in science? \n40:45 - How far behind would astronomy be if Earth didn't have a Moon?\n43:05 - What is the shape of space?\n44:23 - What can we see in the universe?\n46:38 - Is some of our matter from a higher dimension?\n\nSupport us on Patreon: https://www.patreon.com/startalkradio\n\nSubscribe to StarTalk: https://www.youtube.com/user/startalkradio?sub_confirmation=1\n\nFollow StarTalk:\nTwitter: http://twitter.com/startalkradio\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/StarTalk\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/startalkradio/\n\nAbout StarTalk: \nScience meets pop culture on StarTalk!

                        "description": "Why are we here? Who are we? What is the meaning of life? On this episode of StarTalk Radio, Neil deGrasse Tyson and comic co-host Chuck Nice answer fan-submitted Cosmic Queries on a range of topics that stem from the deepest thoughts, ideas, and feelings we share about our place in the universe.\n*Segment timecodes at bottom of description!* \nWhat boggles your mind? The expansion of the universe? The study of black holes? Neil explains why he\u2019s boggled by research being done in the field of neuroscience. We ponder if the human brain will ever fully figure out the human mind. We also ponder if the universe has complexities that the human mind will never comprehend. You\u2019ll learn about the minute differences between human and chimpanzee DNA and what that could mean for humans in comparison to something that could have higher intelligence than us.\n\nWe debate how long humanity will last. We investigate the consequences of humans creating an intelligence greater than our own. You\u2019ll hear why Neil has confidence humanity will last given the collective nature of our intelligence. We ask, \u201cIf the universe is under no obligation to make sense to us, why study it in the first place?\u201d Neil tells us why our five senses limit us from fully grasping certain elements and constructs of the universe \u2013 and how science picks up the slack. \n\nWe talk about the aging process and the idea of living forever. Then, we dive into the big question: what is the meaning of life? Neil shares his thoughts on how he finds meaning in his own life. You\u2019ll learn why, whenever you look out into the universe, you\u2019re looking at the past. \n\nDiscover more about the vacuum of space. We also discuss what should be the priority, or priorities, in space exploration. Lastly, you\u2019ll learn about higher dimensions and if they\u2019re bleeding into our own universe. All that, plus, find out more about the shape of space itself. \n\nThis episode originally aired as a podcast on September 27, 2019.\n\n#StarTalk #NeildeGrasseTyson #Space\n\nSegment Timecodes\n0:00 - Introduction\n3:05 - What boggles Neil's mind? \n12:30 - What is the point of science? \n18:31 - Who has a deeper voice? \n19:06 - How long will the human race survive?\n28:10 - What is the meaning of our human existence?\n33:10 - How is space a vacuum?\n39:01 - Lightning Round\n39:10 - What should be our priority in science? \n40:45 - How far behind would astronomy be if Earth didn't have a Moon?\n43:05 - What is the shape of space?\n44:23 - What can we see in the universe?\n46:38 - Is some of our matter from a higher dimension?\n\nSupport us on Patreon: https://www.patreon.com/startalkradio\n\nSubscribe to StarTalk: https://www.youtube.com/user/startalkradio?sub_confirmation=1\n\nFollow StarTalk:\nTwitter: http://twitter.com/startalkradio\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/StarTalk\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/startalkradio/\n\nAbout StarTalk: \nScience meets pop culture on StarTalk!

On this episode of StarTalk Radio, Neil deGrasse Tyson answers your fan-submitted questions about the mysteries, wonders, and theories that exist on the bleeding edge of cosmology.

We explore the idea of the multiverse and the idea of our universe never having an \u201cedge.\u201d Could those distant galaxies we see be our own galaxy in the past?

On this episode of StarTalk, Neil DeGrasse Tyson and comic co-host Chuck Nice unveil some of the subjects covered in the new StarTalk book named after our recurring segment Cosmic Queries. Theoretical cosmologist and Director of Sciences at Pioneer Works, Janna Levin, helps us break down the building blocks of the universe and how it started. \n\nTo start things off, you\u2019ll learn what the galaxy is made of, both objects we can see and things we cannot. We take a deep, dark dive into dark matter. How much dark matter is there? Are neutrinos a form of dark matter? Has there always been the same amount of matter and dark matter? Could there be a universe with dark matter that is parallel to ours? Find out why someday dark energy will win over the universe. We discuss why theorizing something undetectable and even unprovable may still be a scientific question. \n\nTo kick-off questions from our patrons, we explore the Large Hadron Collider (LHC). What has it enabled us to discover? What has it not discovered yet? Could the LHC make a black hole? You\u2019ll learn about the discovery of the Higgs particle and other elusive objects. We dive into the scientific method physicists use in predicting theories and what physicists really want. \n\nWe also explain string theory and the harmonics of subatomic particles, and how there \u201ccan\u2019t be nothing.\u201d Learn why nothing isn\u2019t as empty as you imagine and how spacetime is malleable. Is everything in the universe just a point on a string? Discover all that and more, including how quantum mechanics create spacetime, on another exciting episode!\n\nThanks to our Patrons Sunny Day, Shain Dholakiya, Penny Joy, Ben Miller, Eric Lamont, Fernando Sepulveda, Caleb Nolan, Beverly Bellows, Pedro, and Chris Mank for supporting us this week.\n\nNOTE: StarTalk+ Patrons can watch or listen to this entire episode commercial-free.\n\nSupport us on Patreon: https://www.patreon.com/startalkradio\n\nFOLLOW or SUBSCRIBE to StarTalk:\nYouTube: https://www.youtube.com/user/startalkradio?sub_confirmation=1\nTwitter: http://twitter.com/startalkradio\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/StarTalk\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/startalkradio/\n\nAbout StarTalk: \nScience meets pop culture on StarTalk!

                    "description": "On this episode of StarTalk Radio, Neil deGrasse Tyson and comic co-host Chuck Nice are answering a grab bag full of fan-submitted Cosmic Queries on topics ranging from dark matter to the end of the universe. \n\nWhat is dark matter? Could it be another universe\u2019s gravity bleeding into our own universe? You\u2019ll learn what the leading possibilities are to explain dark matter. Neil and Chuck dive into field theory. Discover more about our expanding universe. We discuss our eventual collision with the Andromeda galaxy. Neil explains how the universe might have removed chapters from its own history, forever hiding it from us.\n\nWhat would it be like if you grew up on Venus? Because of the thick atmosphere, would you be aware of other places in the galaxy? We ponder if we can use gravitational waves to communicate with life in other universes. You\u2019ll also find out how the electromagnetic spectrum serves as a window to the universe.\n\nTo kick off the last segment, Neil gets asked a big question: How does it all end? You\u2019ll hear why the universe will end not in a bang, but, with a whimper. You\u2019ll also hear about \u201cThe Big Rip.\u201d Lastly, we explore the SN 1987A \u2013 the most recent supernova witnessed by humans. All that plus, we investigate the relationship between science and art. \n\nThanks to our Patrons Kyle Marston, Caleb Martin, Zachary Zahn, David Liebert, Caralee Wahab, Michael Hoogwater, Robert Gowing, Tracy Skrabut, Henry Drefeldt, and Pyry Sipil\u00e4inen for supporting us this week.\n\nSupport us on Patreon: https://www.patreon.com/startalkradio\n\n\"Black Swan\u201d & \"White Swan\" limited edition serigraph prints by Coast Salish artist Jane Kwatleematt Marston.

                        "description": "On this episode of StarTalk Radio, Neil deGrasse Tyson and comic co-host Chuck Nice are answering a grab bag full of fan-submitted Cosmic Queries on topics ranging from dark matter to the end of the universe. \n\nWhat is dark matter? Could it be another universe\u2019s gravity bleeding into our own universe? You\u2019ll learn what the leading possibilities are to explain dark matter. Neil and Chuck dive into field theory. Discover more about our expanding universe. We discuss our eventual collision with the Andromeda galaxy. Neil explains how the universe might have removed chapters from its own history, forever hiding it from us.\n\nWhat would it be like if you grew up on Venus? Because of the thick atmosphere, would you be aware of other places in the galaxy? We ponder if we can use gravitational waves to communicate with life in other universes. You\u2019ll also find out how the electromagnetic spectrum serves as a window to the universe.\n\nTo kick off the last segment, Neil gets asked a big question: How does it all end? You\u2019ll hear why the universe will end not in a bang, but, with a whimper. You\u2019ll also hear about \u201cThe Big Rip.\u201d Lastly, we explore the SN 1987A \u2013 the most recent supernova witnessed by humans. All that plus, we investigate the relationship between science and art. \n\nThanks to our Patrons Kyle Marston, Caleb Martin, Zachary Zahn, David Liebert, Caralee Wahab, Michael Hoogwater, Robert Gowing, Tracy Skrabut, Henry Drefeldt, and Pyry Sipil\u00e4inen for supporting us this week.\n\nSupport us on Patreon: https://www.patreon.com/startalkradio\n\n\"Black Swan\u201d & \"White Swan\" limited edition serigraph prints by Coast Salish artist Jane Kwatleematt Marston.

On this episode of StarTalk Radio, Neil deGrasse Tyson and comic co-host Chuck Nice are exploring timekeeping with Anthony Aveni, the Russell Colgate Distinguished University Professor Emeritus of Astronomy, Anthropology, and Native American Studies.\n\nWe start with the basics of time. What\u2019s the difference between taking the measure of time vs. using an activity as a measurement of time? If we didn\u2019t have astronomy, how would we measure time? You\u2019ll learn why there are places in the universe that the measurement of time would be pointless. \n\nWhy did the ancients start keeping time? Anthony tells us why it, surprisingly, might have to do with bureaucracy. We investigate how we use atoms to keep the most precise time and what would happen if those atoms change their behavior. If we adjusted the scales of time to make years shorter would that make people happier?\n\nWe ponder if aliens visiting Earth might have a different understanding of time. We discuss the film Arrival and explore non-linear time. You\u2019ll learn why Judeo-Christian teachings needed a linear construct of time. Could we get rid of time zones?

What happens when the person taking the test is smarter than the person who wrote the test? You\u2019ll learn what it was like for Neil to be a student. Then we dive into the questions. Why are there so many spirals in nature? Neil tells us about his experiences filming Cosmos in a redwood forest and seeing spirals along the trunks of trees. You\u2019ll learn about spiral galaxies and \u201cdensity waves.\u201d \n\nThen, we investigate the rise and fall of the Arecibo Observatory. Neil gives us a history lesson on the significance of the telescope and it\u2019s functionality. We discuss the slow demise and eventual shut down of the telescope. You\u2019ll also learn about the Five hundred meter Aperture Spherical Telescope in China that\u2019s currently the world\u2019s largest filled-aperture radio telescope. Neil also explains why the plight of the Arecibo Observatory is a metaphor for science in America. \n\nWe ponder if machines can ever truly make art. Neil gives us his definition of art and why he thinks the only way for a machine to make art is to be a genuine artificial intelligence. What\u2019s the most fascinating thing we\u2019ve discovered in the known universe? Neil tells us why you can\u2019t beat black holes. You\u2019ll hear how scientists first discovered signatures of a black hole. All that, plus, discover more about the expansion of the universe and if it will end with the annihilation of spacetime.  \n\nIn this episode, we\u2019re spotlighting Cosmic Queries submitted by Patron Joel Cherrico. If you would like to have your questions featured in an episode through audio/video interaction with Neil, check out our Custom Queries reward on Patreon.\n\nThanks to our Patrons Joel Cherrico, Cory Farnum, Patti Weber, Vegard Gjertsen, Christopher Ludwig, Maria Atienza, Darshan Parmar, Larry Streeter, Kaleb Saleeby, Gregory Newman, and Jeffrey Moore for supporting us this week.\n\nSupport us on Patreon: https://www.patreon.com/startalkradio\n\nFOLLOW or SUBSCRIBE to StarTalk:\nYouTube: https://www.youtube.com/user/startalkradio?sub_confirmation=1\nTwitter: http://twitter.com/startalkradio\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/StarTalk\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/startalkradio/\n\nAbout StarTalk: \nScience meets pop culture on StarTalk!
