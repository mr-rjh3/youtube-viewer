                    "description": "Automakers are offering steep discounts on electric vehicles, and especially on leases. In the first three months of 2024, less than a quarter of car buyers leased vehicles, but more than a third of EV buyers did. By May, nearly 70% of customers getting EVs through dealerships were leased. But EV leasing is problematic for carmakers. While the discounts suggest automakers could be offsetting losses in their EV businesses, the resale values are especially low for them.\n\nChapters:\n00:57 Title card: Why EVs have a leasing problem \n01:04 Chapter 1: Leasing and EVs\n02:54 Chapter 2: Consumers and leasing\n06:10 Chapter 3: Automakers and leasing\n10:02 Chapter 4: Future of EV leasing\n\nProducer: Robert Ferris\nEditor: Darren Geeter \nAnimation: Christina Locopo\nSenior Managing Producer: Tala Hadavi\nAdditional footage: Getty Images, Rivian, Tesla, Ford, GM, Hyundai, Polestar\n\n\u00bb Subscribe to CNBC: https://cnb.cx/SubscribeCNBC\n\u00bb Subscribe to CNBC TV: https://cnb.cx/SubscribeCNBCtelevision\n\nAbout CNBC: From 'Wall Street' to 'Main Street' to award winning original documentaries and Reality TV series, CNBC has you covered.

                        "description": "Automakers are offering steep discounts on electric vehicles, and especially on leases. In the first three months of 2024, less than a quarter of car buyers leased vehicles, but more than a third of EV buyers did. By May, nearly 70% of customers getting EVs through dealerships were leased. But EV leasing is problematic for carmakers. While the discounts suggest automakers could be offsetting losses in their EV businesses, the resale values are especially low for them.\n\nChapters:\n00:57 Title card: Why EVs have a leasing problem \n01:04 Chapter 1: Leasing and EVs\n02:54 Chapter 2: Consumers and leasing\n06:10 Chapter 3: Automakers and leasing\n10:02 Chapter 4: Future of EV leasing\n\nProducer: Robert Ferris\nEditor: Darren Geeter \nAnimation: Christina Locopo\nSenior Managing Producer: Tala Hadavi\nAdditional footage: Getty Images, Rivian, Tesla, Ford, GM, Hyundai, Polestar\n\n\u00bb Subscribe to CNBC: https://cnb.cx/SubscribeCNBC\n\u00bb Subscribe to CNBC TV: https://cnb.cx/SubscribeCNBCtelevision\n\nAbout CNBC: From 'Wall Street' to 'Main Street' to award winning original documentaries and Reality TV series, CNBC has you covered.

                    "description": "#loneliness #depression #surgery\n\nWhat does loneliness have to do with surgery? Why did the surgeon general declare a loneliness epidemic?\n\n\ud83d\udc9b Learn about Dr. Kaveh's transformational Ketamine clinic: https://www.clarus-health.com\n\ud83d\udd35 Ask personalized questions in private live streams + more: https://www.medicalsecretsmd.com/exclusive\n\u2b55 Join the FREE discord: https://discord.gg/FTYbxH6yNB\n\nI'll share the impacts of loneliness on both mental and physical health, exploring the associated risks of heart disease, stroke, and dementia. As loneliness continues to be a pressing issue in today's society, understanding its far-reaching consequences becomes increasingly important.\n\nLoneliness has been linked to various health issues, affecting not only emotional well-being but also increasing the risk of several chronic conditions. We'll discuss the connection between loneliness and the following health risks:\n\nHeart disease\nStroke\nDementia\n\nWe will also examine the unique challenges loneliness poses for individuals undergoing anesthesia for surgery. In particular, we'll explore how worsened depression or anxiety can heighten the risks of postoperative pain and nausea.\n\n\ud83d\udc94 Heart Disease Risk and Loneliness\n\nResearch has indicated a strong association between loneliness and the development of heart disease. Lonely individuals may be more susceptible to inflammation and high blood pressure, both of which are risk factors for heart disease. Additionally, feelings of isolation can contribute to unhealthy lifestyle choices, such as poor diet and lack of exercise, further exacerbating the risk of heart problems.\n\n\ud83e\udde0 Stroke Risk and Loneliness\n\nLike heart disease, loneliness has been linked to an increased risk of stroke. The stress and inflammation associated with chronic loneliness can lead to vascular changes, which may contribute to the development of stroke. Furthermore, loneliness can result in poor health habits and increased stress levels, both of which can elevate stroke risk.\n\n\ud83d\udd0d Dementia Risk and Loneliness\n\nLoneliness has been identified as a potential risk factor for dementia. Social isolation and a lack of mental stimulation may accelerate cognitive decline, increasing the likelihood of developing dementia. Research suggests that maintaining strong social connections and staying mentally engaged can help protect against cognitive decline and dementia.\n\n\ud83d\udc89 The Implications of Loneliness for Anesthesia and Surgery\n\nFor individuals undergoing surgery, loneliness can pose unique challenges. Specifically, the worsening of pre-existing depression or anxiety due to loneliness can increase the risks associated with anesthesia and postoperative recovery. In this video, we'll discuss how these risks manifest themselves, including:\n\nIncreased postoperative pain: Heightened anxiety and depression can lower an individual's pain threshold, leading to more significant postoperative pain and a higher demand for pain medication.\nGreater risk of postoperative nausea: Those with worsened depression or anxiety may be more susceptible to postoperative nausea and vomiting, a common side effect of anesthesia.\nProlonged recovery time: Mental health issues related to loneliness can interfere with the body's natural healing processes, potentially lengthening recovery time and increasing the risk of complications.\n\nThis live stream offers a comprehensive look at the far-reaching effects of loneliness on mental and physical health, emphasizing the importance of addressing this issue to ensure overall well-being. By understanding the risks associated with loneliness, including those related to anesthesia and surgery, we can take steps to alleviate its impact and promote a healthier, more connected society.\n\nDon't forget to like, comment, and subscribe for more videos on health, wellness, and the power of human connection!\n\nThis video/speech/channel DOES NOT CONSTITUTE MEDICAL ADVICE.

                        "description": "#loneliness #depression #surgery\n\nWhat does loneliness have to do with surgery? Why did the surgeon general declare a loneliness epidemic?\n\n\ud83d\udc9b Learn about Dr. Kaveh's transformational Ketamine clinic: https://www.clarus-health.com\n\ud83d\udd35 Ask personalized questions in private live streams + more: https://www.medicalsecretsmd.com/exclusive\n\u2b55 Join the FREE discord: https://discord.gg/FTYbxH6yNB\n\nI'll share the impacts of loneliness on both mental and physical health, exploring the associated risks of heart disease, stroke, and dementia. As loneliness continues to be a pressing issue in today's society, understanding its far-reaching consequences becomes increasingly important.\n\nLoneliness has been linked to various health issues, affecting not only emotional well-being but also increasing the risk of several chronic conditions. We'll discuss the connection between loneliness and the following health risks:\n\nHeart disease\nStroke\nDementia\n\nWe will also examine the unique challenges loneliness poses for individuals undergoing anesthesia for surgery. In particular, we'll explore how worsened depression or anxiety can heighten the risks of postoperative pain and nausea.\n\n\ud83d\udc94 Heart Disease Risk and Loneliness\n\nResearch has indicated a strong association between loneliness and the development of heart disease. Lonely individuals may be more susceptible to inflammation and high blood pressure, both of which are risk factors for heart disease. Additionally, feelings of isolation can contribute to unhealthy lifestyle choices, such as poor diet and lack of exercise, further exacerbating the risk of heart problems.\n\n\ud83e\udde0 Stroke Risk and Loneliness\n\nLike heart disease, loneliness has been linked to an increased risk of stroke. The stress and inflammation associated with chronic loneliness can lead to vascular changes, which may contribute to the development of stroke. Furthermore, loneliness can result in poor health habits and increased stress levels, both of which can elevate stroke risk.\n\n\ud83d\udd0d Dementia Risk and Loneliness\n\nLoneliness has been identified as a potential risk factor for dementia. Social isolation and a lack of mental stimulation may accelerate cognitive decline, increasing the likelihood of developing dementia. Research suggests that maintaining strong social connections and staying mentally engaged can help protect against cognitive decline and dementia.\n\n\ud83d\udc89 The Implications of Loneliness for Anesthesia and Surgery\n\nFor individuals undergoing surgery, loneliness can pose unique challenges. Specifically, the worsening of pre-existing depression or anxiety due to loneliness can increase the risks associated with anesthesia and postoperative recovery. In this video, we'll discuss how these risks manifest themselves, including:\n\nIncreased postoperative pain: Heightened anxiety and depression can lower an individual's pain threshold, leading to more significant postoperative pain and a higher demand for pain medication.\nGreater risk of postoperative nausea: Those with worsened depression or anxiety may be more susceptible to postoperative nausea and vomiting, a common side effect of anesthesia.\nProlonged recovery time: Mental health issues related to loneliness can interfere with the body's natural healing processes, potentially lengthening recovery time and increasing the risk of complications.\n\nThis live stream offers a comprehensive look at the far-reaching effects of loneliness on mental and physical health, emphasizing the importance of addressing this issue to ensure overall well-being. By understanding the risks associated with loneliness, including those related to anesthesia and surgery, we can take steps to alleviate its impact and promote a healthier, more connected society.\n\nDon't forget to like, comment, and subscribe for more videos on health, wellness, and the power of human connection!\n\nThis video/speech/channel DOES NOT CONSTITUTE MEDICAL ADVICE.

In this video, we examine the effects of marijuana on anesthetics, particularly focusing on propofol, opioids, and benzodiazepines. Cannabis can influence the body's response to these drugs, often making it more challenging for anesthesiologists to predict and manage a patient's reactions during surgery.\n\nWe further explore the risks of heightened post-operative nausea and vomiting (PONV) associated with cannabis use. While marijuana is often touted for its anti-nausea properties, studies show that the regular use of cannabis may actually increase the risk of PONV, a common and uncomfortable surgical complication. This can lead to extended hospital stays and additional treatments.\n\nAnother major point of discussion is post-operative pain management. Although medical marijuana can have a role in chronic pain management, cannabis use in surgical contexts can cause issues. Regular marijuana users may experience increased pain sensitivity after surgery, which may lead to higher requirements for opioids, thereby increasing the risk of opioid-related side effects.\n\nChronic (like daily) marijuana use also increases anesthesia requirements. This may increase the risk of being \"underdosed\" anesthesia and causing undesired anesthesia awareness.\n\nThe metabolization of THC and CBD, the two main active compounds in cannabis, is an area that deserves careful scrutiny. These compounds can interact with other medications in the body, potentially leading to a range of unwanted side effects after surgery. These complications, though preventable, are not widely understood.\n\nDespite the risks outlined, I also acknowledge the role of medical marijuana in patient care. Medical cannabis has been used effectively in managing chronic pain, nausea, and other health conditions when used responsibly. However, it's crucial to understand that its use during and after surgery is a different context altogether, given the potential interactions with other medications and the body's altered physiological state.\n\nWe strongly advocate for open conversations with your medical team about all drug use habits, including cannabis. Transparency can be a lifeline in surgical settings, allowing for personalized anesthesia plans and minimizing the potential for unexpected complications.\n\nReferences:\nhttps://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36596580/\n\nThis video/speech/channel DOES NOT CONSTITUTE MEDICAL ADVICE.

Can you prevent the changes to depression, memory, body weight, bleeding, anxiety, and more?\n\n\ud83d\udc9b Learn about Dr. Kaveh's transformational Ketamine clinic: https://www.clarus-health.com\n\ud83d\udd35 Ask personalized questions in private live streams + more: https://www.medicalsecretsmd.com/exclusive\n\u2b55 Join the FREE discord: https://discord.gg/FTYbxH6yNB\n\nWe explore how undergoing multiple surgeries impacts not only the physical aspect of the body but also the psychological and cognitive dimensions. Our discussion touches upon surgical risks such as adhesions, blood clots, chronic pain, weight gain, and blood loss; mental health risks like depression, PTSD, and loneliness; and anesthesia risks, including tolerance and post-operative cognitive deficits.\n\nWe'll talk about pet therapy, and you may see Karma make a cameo appearance! :)\n\nFirstly, we delve into the physical effects multiple surgeries can have. Adhesions, essentially internal scar tissue, can create painful or potentially dangerous connections between organs. Blood clots, another common risk, can break off and move through your bloodstream to your heart, lungs, or brain, leading to potentially fatal conditions. Chronic pain can result from damage to nerves during surgery, and weight gain can be linked to reduced mobility post-surgery. Additionally, blood loss is a natural part of any surgical procedure, but multiple surgeries can elevate this risk.\n\nNext, we move to the mental health impacts of multiple surgeries. It's not uncommon for individuals to experience depression, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), and feelings of loneliness due to the physical stress and isolation that can come with multiple surgeries. These conditions can exacerbate post-surgical recovery and quality of life, necessitating mental health care alongside physical recovery.\n\nAnesthesia, although crucial for surgical procedures, isn't without risks. One could develop tolerance over time, meaning more anesthesia may be needed for the same effect. Also, post-operative cognitive deficits like memory loss or difficulty concentrating can occur, especially among older adults or those who've undergone multiple procedures.\n\nBut it's not all gloomy. There are strategies and preventative measures one can adopt to minimize these risks. Our video explains the critical role that a healthy lifestyle plays before surgery. Reducing substance use is key as substances like nicotine and alcohol can interfere with anesthesia and recovery. Good nutrition is also vital as it helps your body heal more efficiently. We also shed light on optimizing cardiovascular fitness, which improves the body's resilience to the stresses of surgery and aids in a quicker recovery.\n\nImportantly, mental health should not be overlooked in surgical preparation and recovery. Treating existing conditions like depression and anxiety, increasing social connectedness to alleviate feelings of loneliness, and keeping a positive mental attitude can significantly improve the surgical experience and recovery.\n\nWe also highlight the importance of good blood glucose control before surgery, as uncontrolled blood sugar can lead to complications such as infections, delayed healing, and even higher mortality rates.\n\nLastly, we emphasize that you should always have an open line of communication with your doctor about your concerns. They can provide the right information and guidance that will help you to make an informed decision and be at peace with your surgical journey.\n\nThis video/speech/channel DOES NOT CONSTITUTE MEDICAL ADVICE.

Understand the importance of proper pain management and its role in preventing acute pain from becoming chronic.\n\nRedefining Chronic Pain in Today's World:\nExplore how new technology, cancer survivorship, and treatable conditions like HIV neuropathy call for updated definitions of chronic pain. Discover how these advances contribute to longer lives but also create new challenges in pain management.\n\nThe Pendulum Effects in Medicine:\nDelve into the history of opioids, SSRIs, stimulants, genetic testing, and GLP-1 agonists like Ozempic and Mounjaro, examining their impact on chronic pain treatment over time. Understand the importance of balance and individualization in medical treatments.\n\nAdvocating for Better Chronic Pain Management:\nMaster effective ways to advocate for yourself or your loved ones. Learn about the ladder approach, authorizing behavioral help treatments, engaging in discussions about opioids, and urging senators to fund individualized treatment per CDC guidelines.\n\nJoin our community of chronic pain warriors and be part of the conversation as we navigate the challenges of pain management together.

Patients may feel scared, uncertain, and out of control, and these emotions can lead to acting out behaviors such as anger, frustration, and lashing out at doctors and nurses.\n\nOne of the main reasons why patients may act out in these situations is due to their vulnerability. Patients are often placed in situations where they feel helpless and powerless, and this can be a very distressing experience. Fear and uncertainty can also contribute to these feelings, as patients may not know what to expect or how to navigate the medical system.\n\nIn addition, feeling alone can also lead to acting out behaviors. Patients who do not have adequate emotional support may feel isolated and alone, and this can exacerbate feelings of vulnerability and fear. Lashing out at doctors and nurses may be a way for patients to express their frustration and cope with these difficult emotions.\n\nIt is important for doctors and nurses to respond to these behaviors with compassion and understanding. While it can be difficult to deal with patients who are acting out, it is important to remember that these behaviors are often a result of fear and uncertainty. Becoming angry or frustrated with patients can only exacerbate the situation and make it more difficult for everyone involved.\n\nIn addition, patient care before surgery and anesthesia is particularly important. Patients who are about to undergo surgery or anesthesia may be feeling particularly vulnerable and scared, and this can lead to acting out behaviors. Doctors and nurses need to take the time to provide emotional support and address the patient's concerns, as this can help to reduce anxiety and improve the overall surgical experience.\n\nProviding emotional support can take many forms. Simply taking the time to listen to the patient's concerns and providing reassurance can go a long way towards making them feel more comfortable and less alone. Additionally, providing educational materials and resources can help to empower patients and give them a sense of control over their situation.\n\nIn conclusion, patients may act out with doctors and nurses in vulnerable and delicate situations due to their feelings of vulnerability, fear, and uncertainty. Feeling alone can also contribute to acting out behaviors. It is important for doctors and nurses to respond to these behaviors with compassion and understanding, as this can help to reduce anxiety and improve the overall patient experience. Additionally, patient care before surgery and anesthesia is particularly important, and doctors and nurses need to take the time to provide emotional support and address the patient's concerns.

It's important to note that triggers are exuberant responses to external stimuli (sometimes internal stimuli), and it's crucial to approach patients with compassion and respect while still empowering them to take agency and responsibility over their health.\n\nAs a healthcare professional, I understand the importance of creating a safe and comfortable environment for patients undergoing surgical procedures. However, there have been times where I have unintentionally triggered patients, causing them to feel scared, anxious, or even traumatized. These experiences have taught me the importance of being mindful of a patient's emotional and mental state before administering any kind of medical treatment.\n\nOne such incident occurred when I was preparing a patient for surgery. I was discussing the details of the procedure with the patient, and I mentioned the possibility of complications that could occur during surgery. Unfortunately, this caused the patient to have a panic attack, which made it challenging for me to continue with the pre-surgical preparations. The patient's reaction was understandable, as surgery can be a frightening prospect, and the patient was likely already feeling vulnerable and anxious.\n\nI'll share another story about a patient with body image insecurities who was triggered by my preoperative questions while I was just trying to ensure their health, safety, and comfort before surgery. This was interpreted with an exuberant response out of proportion to any intention that I had to lay blame or accuse.\n\nIt's essential to understand that triggers can be caused by a wide range of factors, including past traumas, anxiety, and fear. As healthcare professionals, we need to be mindful of these potential triggers and work to create a safe and supportive environment for our patients. This means being compassionate and respectful, as well as empowering patients to take agency and responsibility over their health.\n\nOne way to approach patients with compassion and respect is to practice active listening. Active listening involves paying close attention to what the patient is saying, as well as their nonverbal cues. This can help us better understand the patient's emotional and mental state and provide them with the support they need.\n\nAnother way to empower patients is to involve them in the decision-making process. By involving patients in their medical treatment, we can help them feel more in control of their health, which can be empowering and help reduce anxiety.\n\nAs doctors, it's our responsibility to create a safe and supportive environment for our patients. This means being mindful of potential triggers and working to create a compassionate and respectful environment. By practicing active listening and involving patients in the decision-making process, we can help empower them to take agency and responsibility over their health.

Are there side effects and complications?\n\n\ud83d\udc9b Learn about Dr. Kaveh's transformational Ketamine clinic: https://www.clarus-health.com\n\ud83d\udd35 Ask personalized questions in private live streams + more: https://www.medicalsecretsmd.com/exclusive\n\u2b55 Join the FREE discord: https://discord.gg/FTYbxH6yNB\n\nI'll share my personal experiences as a healthcare professional where I have accidentally triggered patients before surgery and anesthesia. It's important to note that triggers are exuberant responses to external stimuli (sometimes internal stimuli), and it's crucial to approach patients with compassion and respect while still empowering them to take agency and responsibility over their health.\n\nAs a healthcare professional, I understand the importance of creating a safe and comfortable environment for patients undergoing surgical procedures. However, there have been times where I have unintentionally triggered patients, causing them to feel scared, anxious, or even traumatized. These experiences have taught me the importance of being mindful of a patient's emotional and mental state before administering any kind of medical treatment.\n\nOne such incident occurred when I was preparing a patient for surgery. I was discussing the details of the procedure with the patient, and I mentioned the possibility of complications that could occur during surgery. Unfortunately, this caused the patient to have a panic attack, which made it challenging for me to continue with the pre-surgical preparations. The patient's reaction was understandable, as surgery can be a frightening prospect, and the patient was likely already feeling vulnerable and anxious.\n\nI'll share another story about a patient with body image insecurities who was triggered by my preoperative questions while I was just trying to ensure their health, safety, and comfort before surgery. This was interpreted with an exuberant response out of proportion to any intention that I had to lay blame or accuse.\n\nIt's essential to understand that triggers can be caused by a wide range of factors, including past traumas, anxiety, and fear. As healthcare professionals, we need to be mindful of these potential triggers and work to create a safe and supportive environment for our patients. This means being compassionate and respectful, as well as empowering patients to take agency and responsibility over their health.\n\nOne way to approach patients with compassion and respect is to practice active listening. Active listening involves paying close attention to what the patient is saying, as well as their nonverbal cues. This can help us better understand the patient's emotional and mental state and provide them with the support they need.\n\nAnother way to empower patients is to involve them in the decision-making process. By involving patients in their medical treatment, we can help them feel more in control of their health, which can be empowering and help reduce anxiety.\n\nAs doctors, it's our responsibility to create a safe and supportive environment for our patients. This means being mindful of potential triggers and working to create a compassionate and respectful environment. By practicing active listening and involving patients in the decision-making process, we can help empower them to take agency and responsibility over their health. It's important to remember that triggers are exuberant responses to external stimuli (sometimes internal stimuli), and it's crucial to approach patients with compassion and respect while still empowering them to take control of their health.\n\nThis video/speech/channel DOES NOT CONSTITUTE MEDICAL ADVICE.

In relationships where power dynamics are significantly skewed, such as those between doctors and patients, gaslighting can take hold. This form of manipulation can cause patients to question their own experiences and symptoms, leading to a damaging cycle that can significantly affect their mental and physical health.\n\nOur primary focus in this video is not to perpetuate a culture of victimhood but to empower patients to advocate for themselves. We're providing a comprehensive understanding of medical gaslighting, demonstrating how it can harm patients, and most importantly, fostering a mindset of empowerment.\n\nMedical gaslighting can be a formidable challenge for patients to navigate. Psychological distress caused by gaslighting can manifest as physical symptoms due to the mind-body connection, making this an issue that can't be ignored. As patients, it's crucial to understand what gaslighting looks like and how it can impact the healthcare experience.\n\nWe also explore the broader implications of medical gaslighting. The undermining of patient experiences can erode the trust between patients and healthcare providers, and by extension, affect the overall quality of healthcare.\n\nIn the course of this video, we'll take a thorough look at this phenomenon, discussing its many facets without oversimplifying it to a set of strategies. We believe that fostering an informed patient community is one of the best ways to combat medical gaslighting. With knowledge and understanding, patients can better advocate for their health and contribute to a healthcare environment that values and respects individual experiences.\n\nIn essence, this video is a step toward creating a more compassionate and understanding healthcare space. Together, we can raise awareness about medical gaslighting, empowering patients to take control of their healing journey.\n\nReferences:\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8115954/\nhttps://www.webmd.com/mental-health/signs-sociopath\n\nThis video/speech/channel DOES NOT CONSTITUTE MEDICAL ADVICE.

Why do some people wake up delirious?\n\n\ud83d\udc9b Learn about Dr. Kaveh's transformational Ketamine clinic: https://www.clarus-health.com\n\ud83d\udd35 Ask personalized questions in private live streams + more: https://www.medicalsecretsmd.com/exclusive\n\u2b55 Join the FREE discord: https://discord.gg/FTYbxH6yNB\n\nIn this video, we discuss a critical topic: the length of time anesthesia stays in the body post-surgery. We focus on specific factors such as the type of anesthesia used, the kind of surgery performed, the pre-existing mental health state, and the history of substance use, including marijuana or cannabis.\n\nKey anesthetics like Propofol, Fentanyl, Remifentanil, Sufentanil, Hydromorphone, and Midazolam are addressed. The decision to use and the dosage of these anesthetics hinge on individual patient requirements and the type of surgery. The dosage influences the duration these anesthetics stay in the body, how quickly they metabolize, and how long it takes for the patient to regain consciousness post-anesthesia.\n\nThe type of surgery significantly affects anesthesia duration in the body. Cardiac surgeries and neurosurgeries, for instance, necessitate higher doses of anesthesia due to their complex and lengthy nature. The larger dosage subsequently requires a longer period for the body to metabolize and redistribute the anesthesia.\n\nNeurosurgery, in particular, merits a closer look. As these operations directly impact the brain, an organ that takes a longer time to recover due to its complexity, a higher anesthetic dosage is required. This requirement inevitably leads to a more extended wake-up period from the anesthesia. The body must redistribute and metabolize the high drug concentrations, and the brain needs to re-establish its usual functions after the invasive procedure.\n\nThe mental health state of a patient before surgery also affects anesthesia use. Patients with more anxiety or unresolved PTSD often need higher anesthesia dosages and subsequently experience a longer wake-up time. These conditions may also increase the risk of emergence delirium, a state of confusion that can occur post-anesthesia, further extending the recovery period.\n\nAdditionally, a history of substance use, particularly marijuana or cannabis, influences the dosage and metabolism of anesthesia. Frequent marijuana users may need more anesthetics due to increased tolerance, extending the time for recovery as the body works to metabolize the higher dosage.\n\nEach patient responds to anesthesia differently, and these variables make it challenging to predict the exact recovery time post-anesthesia accurately. Providing complete and accurate medical history aids healthcare providers in administering appropriate care.\n\nThis video is a deep dive into the world of anesthesia and its journey in the body. We examine how various factors can influence its effects, its metabolization, and its significant impact on patient care and recovery. For specific advice regarding your health, consult with your healthcare professional.\n\nThis video/speech/channel DOES NOT CONSTITUTE MEDICAL ADVICE.

The larger dosage subsequently requires a longer period for the body to metabolize and redistribute the anesthesia.\n\nNeurosurgery, in particular, merits a closer look. As these operations directly impact the brain, an organ that takes a longer time to recover due to its complexity, a higher anesthetic dosage is required. This requirement inevitably leads to a more extended wake-up period from the anesthesia. The body must redistribute and metabolize the high drug concentrations, and the brain needs to re-establish its usual functions after the invasive procedure.\n\nThe mental health state of a patient before surgery also affects anesthesia use. Patients with more anxiety or unresolved PTSD often need higher anesthesia dosages and subsequently experience a longer wake-up time. These conditions may also increase the risk of emergence delirium, a state of confusion that can occur post-anesthesia, further extending the recovery period.\n\nAdditionally, a history of substance use, particularly marijuana or cannabis, influences the dosage and metabolism of anesthesia. Frequent marijuana users may need more anesthetics due to increased tolerance, extending the time for recovery as the body works to metabolize the higher dosage.\n\nEach patient responds to anesthesia differently, and these variables make it challenging to predict the exact recovery time post-anesthesia accurately. Providing complete and accurate medical history aids healthcare providers in administering appropriate care.\n\nThis video is a deep dive into the world of anesthesia and its journey in the body. We examine how various factors can influence its effects, its metabolization, and its significant impact on patient care and recovery. For specific advice regarding your health, consult with your healthcare professional.\n\nThis video/speech/channel DOES NOT CONSTITUTE MEDICAL ADVICE.

Here are my top 3 GenZ triggers you've probably never imagined.\n\n\ud83d\udc9b Learn about Dr. Kaveh's transformational Ketamine clinic: https://www.clarus-health.com\n\ud83d\udd35 Ask personalized questions in private live streams + more: https://www.medicalsecretsmd.com/exclusive\n\u2b55 Join the FREE discord: https://discord.gg/FTYbxH6yNB\n\nGeneration Z, or those born between 1996 and 2010, is unlike any generation that came before. They are 'digital natives,' born into a world of technology and the internet. These technologies, particularly smartphones, are an integral part of their lives and even carry over to their doctor visits. For many medical professionals, this can be frustrating and even disruptive. From a Gen Z perspective, though, they see it as a tool for information and a way of multitasking rather than a distraction.\n\nThis generation has a unique ability to rapidly switch their focus between tasks, fueled by a constant stream of digital stimuli. While this behavior may be advantageous in a fast-paced digital world, it can seem inattentive and disrespectful in a healthcare setting. However, it's not as much about a lack of respect as it is about a different way of interacting with the world around them.\n\nYet, this very capability to multitask, when overdone, may lead to a state of constant mental fatigue and an inability to focus on one task at a time. This potential state of perpetual distraction can have health implications, including disrupted sleep patterns.\n\nWith the growing acceptance and legalization of cannabis and the convenience of over-the-counter sleep aids, Generation Z is more likely to turn to these substances to cope. These solutions might seem quicker and less daunting than seeking professional advice. As a result, doctors need to be aware of this trend and approach the discussion of substance use with sensitivity, understanding the societal context in which Gen Z is making these choices.\n\nThe internet, with its wealth of information, has made Generation Z confident in their ability to self-diagnose. Having access to a vast array of health-related data and personal experiences shared online, they feel empowered to take their health into their own hands. They see 'Doctor Google' as a useful tool for understanding their symptoms and possible treatments.\n\nHowever, this reliance on the internet can lead to misinformation and misunderstanding. When faced with professional medical advice that contradicts their online findings, they might react dismissively, leading to the common Gen Z behavior of eye-rolling at doctors. This behavior can strain the doctor-patient relationship and potentially undermine the quality of care.\n\nDespite these potential issues, it's important to note that Gen Z's tech-savvy nature and independent research habits can be harnessed positively in healthcare. In today's digitized world, where telemedicine is gaining ground, Gen Z's digital nature can pave the way for a new era in healthcare delivery.\n\nGen Z's propensity for self-research fosters patient autonomy. They actively seek to understand their health, leading to more informed discussions with their healthcare providers. This proactive approach towards health management can pave the way for a collaborative healthcare system, encouraging dialogue and shared decision-making between patients and doctors.\n\nFurthermore, Gen Z's adeptness with technology can benefit healthcare providers by enabling them to reach out and connect in innovative ways. From sharing health information on social media platforms to offering virtual consultations, providers can meet Gen Z where they are, bridging the gap between traditional and modern healthcare practices.\n\nIn summary, Generation Z's behaviors present both challenges and opportunities in healthcare. Their reliance on technology can be a double-edged sword, causing frustrations among medical professionals but also providing avenues for improved patient autonomy and healthcare delivery. Understanding these behaviors and the reasons behind them is key for healthcare providers to effectively engage with and care for this unique generation.\n\nThis video/speech/channel DOES NOT CONSTITUTE MEDICAL ADVICE.

We aim to answer these questions in our video, with a special focus on generational differences.\n\nWe often assume that patients are fully honest with their doctors. However, this is not always the case. From Generation Z and Millennials to Baby Boomers, each generation has its own patterns of concealment. It\u2019s important to note that these untruths are often not malicious or intentionally deceptive. Instead, they are usually rooted in feelings of guilt, shame, or fear of judgment.\n\nGen Z and Millennials, for example, may not be forthcoming about mental health issues or substance use, including alcohol and marijuana. They might understate their reliance on these substances or downplay their mental health struggles. On the other hand, Baby Boomers might not be transparent about their actual diet and exercise habits or the extent of their tobacco or alcohol use.\n\nOne significant area where honesty becomes critical is medication compliance. Across generations, patients can be less than truthful about how consistently they take prescribed medications. This lack of transparency can be harmful, as it can prevent healthcare providers from making informed decisions and providing the best care possible.\n\nIn this video, we shed light on these issues, discuss the potential harm they can cause, and most importantly, suggest ways to improve openness and trust in the doctor-patient relationship. We highlight how understanding and addressing these tendencies to withhold the truth can lead to better health outcomes. We also underscore the importance of building a non-judgmental space where patients can be honest without fear.\n\nOur aim is to enable healthcare providers to better understand their patients and empower patients to feel safe being honest about their health. Whether you're a medical professional seeking to enhance your relationship with patients, or a patient wanting to improve your healthcare experience, this video is designed to help.\n\nSo, let's delve into this crucial topic together, shedding light on the truth about lies in healthcare. The goal? To pave the way for more honest, effective, and empathetic healthcare for all. By encouraging truth-telling, we can ensure that everyone receives the care they truly need and deserve. Join us as we unravel the complex layers of patient dishonesty and work together towards a healthier, more honest future.\n\nThis video/speech/channel DOES NOT CONSTITUTE MEDICAL ADVICE.
