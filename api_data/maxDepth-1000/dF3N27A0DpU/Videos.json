WIth it came the dangerous Trial Chambers, a cool new mode for experienced players to test their strength, but I was a bit more focused on something else they added\u2026 The Breeze.

Through our songs and animations, kids around the world can learn about colors, letters, life skills, good habits, safety tips, and more in a fun and educational way.\n\nIn the eyes of Kiki and Miumiu, all things are alive: you can talk to animals, you can make friends with vehicles... All the activities can be enjoyed, you can experience different occupations, you can go everywhere... All the unknowns are interesting: what will be in space? Are there aliens on earth?... Join Kiki and Miumiu for the exploration of this world together!\n\nCopyright \u00a9BABYBUS CO.Ltd All Rights Reserved."

She is four years old and lives with Mummy Pig, Daddy Pig and her little brother George. Peppa likes playing with her best friend Suzy Sheep, visiting Granny and Grandpa Pig and looking after George. Most of all, Peppa loves jumping up and down in muddy puddles, laughing and making loud snorting noises. \nGeorge Pig is Peppa\u2019s little brother. He is 18 months old and loves to play with his big sister, Peppa \u2013 even when she\u2019s being bossy. George\u2019s favourite thing is his toy dinosaur. He carries it everywhere with him. George can\u2019t speak yet but can say one word very well: \u2018Dine-saw!\u2019 \nMummy Pig likes jumping up and down in muddy puddles almost as much as Peppa. She works from home on her computer and sometimes lets Peppa and George help, as long as they don\u2019t bash the keyboard. She is better at map reading than Daddy Pig and is very wise about most things. \nDaddy Pig is very jolly and laughs all the time, especially when he plays with Peppa and George. Daddy Pig reads the paper and gets excited about trips in the car. He loves cookies and pumpkin pie and Peppa teases him about his big round tummy. Daddy Pig can be a tiny bit grumpy sometimes when he can\u2019t remember where he put his glasses. \n\nHave fun with Peppa Pig and her friends: Suzy Sheep, Rebecca Rabbit, Danny Dog, Candy Cat, Pedro Pony, Zoe Zebra, Emily Elephant, Freddy Fox, Kylie Kangaroo, Wendy Wolf, Gabriella Goat, Gerald Giraffe, Molly Mole, Belinda Bear, Delphine Donkey, Peggi and Pandora Panda, Mandy Mouse, Simon Squirrel! \n\nOur suggestions: \nCocomelon: https://bit.ly/3g3uYpQ \nBabyBus - Nursery Rhymes: https://bit.ly/3fs3U0Y \nLittle Angel: https://bit.ly/3dSmHlP \n\nPEPPA PIG \u00a9 ASTLEY BAKER DAVIES LTD/ENTERTAINMENT ONE UK LTD 2003.

She is four years old and lives with Mummy Pig, Daddy Pig and her little brother George. Peppa likes playing with her best friend Suzy Sheep, visiting Granny and Grandpa Pig and looking after George. Most of all, Peppa loves jumping up and down in muddy puddles, laughing and making loud snorting noises. \nGeorge Pig is Peppa\u2019s little brother. He is 18 months old and loves to play with his big sister, Peppa \u2013 even when she\u2019s being bossy. George\u2019s favourite thing is his toy dinosaur. He carries it everywhere with him. George can\u2019t speak yet but can say one word very well: \u2018Dine-saw!\u2019 \nMummy Pig likes jumping up and down in muddy puddles almost as much as Peppa. She works from home on her computer and sometimes lets Peppa and George help, as long as they don\u2019t bash the keyboard. She is better at map reading than Daddy Pig and is very wise about most things. \nDaddy Pig is very jolly and laughs all the time, especially when he plays with Peppa and George. Daddy Pig reads the paper and gets excited about trips in the car. He loves cookies and pumpkin pie and Peppa teases him about his big round tummy. Daddy Pig can be a tiny bit grumpy sometimes when he can\u2019t remember where he put his glasses. \n\nHave fun with Peppa Pig and her friends: Suzy Sheep, Rebecca Rabbit, Danny Dog, Candy Cat, Pedro Pony, Zoe Zebra, Emily Elephant, Freddy Fox, Kylie Kangaroo, Wendy Wolf, Gabriella Goat, Gerald Giraffe, Molly Mole, Belinda Bear, Delphine Donkey, Peggi and Pandora Panda, Mandy Mouse, Simon Squirrel! \n\nOur suggestions: \nCocomelon: https://bit.ly/3g3uYpQ \nBabyBus - Nursery Rhymes: https://bit.ly/3fs3U0Y \nLittle Angel: https://bit.ly/3dSmHlP \n\nPEPPA PIG \u00a9 ASTLEY BAKER DAVIES LTD/ENTERTAINMENT ONE UK LTD 2003.

George can\u2019t speak yet but can say one word very well: \u2018Dine-saw!\u2019 \nMummy Pig likes jumping up and down in muddy puddles almost as much as Peppa. She works from home on her computer and sometimes lets Peppa and George help, as long as they don\u2019t bash the keyboard. She is better at map reading than Daddy Pig and is very wise about most things. \nDaddy Pig is very jolly and laughs all the time, especially when he plays with Peppa and George. Daddy Pig reads the paper and gets excited about trips in the car. He loves cookies and pumpkin pie and Peppa teases him about his big round tummy. Daddy Pig can be a tiny bit grumpy sometimes when he can\u2019t remember where he put his glasses. \n\nHave fun with Peppa Pig and her friends: Suzy Sheep, Rebecca Rabbit, Danny Dog, Candy Cat, Pedro Pony, Zoe Zebra, Emily Elephant, Freddy Fox, Kylie Kangaroo, Wendy Wolf, Gabriella Goat, Gerald Giraffe, Molly Mole, Belinda Bear, Delphine Donkey, Peggi and Pandora Panda, Mandy Mouse, Simon Squirrel! \n\nOur suggestions: \nCocomelon: https://bit.ly/3g3uYpQ \nBabyBus - Nursery Rhymes: https://bit.ly/3fs3U0Y \nLittle Angel: https://bit.ly/3dSmHlP \n\nPEPPA PIG \u00a9 ASTLEY BAKER DAVIES LTD/ENTERTAINMENT ONE UK LTD 2003.

Soon after, bugs disturb the kids, and Auntie Beth provides bug lotion to repel the insects.\n\nThe next day, they go fishing together and catch some fish.

In the first race, both teams are neck-and-neck until Kaden's encouragement helps Uncle Jason pull off an amazing cartwheel to win, leaving Eric and Uncle Jim stunned.\n\nThen, in the training zone, Kaden and Uncle Jason work on their fitness, while Eric and Uncle Jim come up with a hilarious plan to gain an edge \u2013 by making Uncle Jim look bigger than Uncle Jason! However, their strategy backfires as Uncle Jason's ballet moves and agility lead his team to victory again.\n\nIn the final challenge, Eric and Uncle Jim realize that size isn't everything. They focus on training and eating healthily, and their hard work pays off as they triumph in the sand jump. Everyone learns that it's not about how big you are, but how hard you train and the fun you have along the way. And, of course, celebrating with pizza!\n\nLesson Learned:\nThe story teaches kids that success comes from hard work and determination, not just physical appearance or size. It also highlights the importance of healthy habits and having fun while competing.\n\nSubscribe for notifications to new videos: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCgFXm4TI8htWmCyJ6cVPG_A?sub_confirmation=1\n\nCheck out our latest videos playlist: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsHnS3mZglg&list=PL5gq3QGk5j3hRwpMNKQ9L5NyUt3FiTmSy",

We were inspired by pokemon go and detective Pikachu move. we wanted to catch our first pokemon. we built a pokestop out of cardboard and even had an incubator for our eggs. this was so much fun that we hatched our first pokemon. we then went outside with some Pokeball and my Pokedex to try and catch a Magikarp but logan ended up catching Gyarados. we then ran into another trainer who challenged us to a pokemon battle at his gym. we fought him to save the day. this was super fun to play and we loved using all the cool toys. we were living a dun dream getting to catch pokemon build a box fort and have tons of funny moments!

                    "description": "Join Flash Ellie, Wonder Woman Maddie, and Supergirl Charlotte in an exciting and fun-filled adventure. In this episode, Flash learns a valuable lesson about teamwork and consideration. As our superheroes help Auntie Amy in various scenarios like reconstructing a broken sculpture, helping Granny cross the street, gardening, and serving ice cream, Flash tends to get a little overenthusiastic. She relies on her super speed, but unintentionally creates more problems than she solves. Wonder Woman and Supergirl kindly show Flash that rushing isn't always the answer, and that careful and considerate actions can often be more helpful. In the end, Flash understands the value of patience and cooperation. She helps the team fetch toppings for the ice cream without dropping them, thanks to taking her time. All superheroes worked as a team to make the day better for Auntie Amy and Granny. The episode ends on a warm note with Flash learning and acknowledging her mistake, proving that everyone has something to learn!\n\nLesson Learned:\nThis episode teaches the importance of patience, consideration for others, and teamwork. It highlights that rushing through tasks may not be the best solution and sometimes it's better to take your time and work together to achieve better results.\n\n\nSubscribe for notifications to new videos: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCgFXm4TI8htWmCyJ6cVPG_A?sub_confirmation=1\n\nCheck out our latest videos playlist: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsHnS3mZglg&list=PL5gq3QGk5j3hRwpMNKQ9L5NyUt3FiTmSy",

Hiding your mess isn\u2019t the same as cleaning it! \ud83e\udd2d\n\nAunty has a funny way of knowing what's hidden, and she threatens to take away all their favorite things\u2014slime for Ellie, video games for Eric, and books for Wendy.\n\nThe kids start cleaning but get easily distracted. Eric's hungry, Wendy finds a long-lost board game, and Ellie reveals a yummy Chocolate Mold Smash Cake \ud83c\udf82! As they play and eat, they forget about their main mission: Cleaning.\n\nFinally, they hear Aunty again and realize they have to wrap it up! But wait, a slime explosion \ud83c\udf08\ud83d\udca5 happens and the room is messier than before. Time is ticking, and Aunty is on her way upstairs!\n\nDo they manage to clean up in time? Well, almost! Aunty finds out and gives them a second chance. The kids team up, clean properly, and even learn a valuable lesson about responsibility and teamwork.\n\nLesson Learned:\nTeamwork makes the dream work!

                        "description": "Ellie, Eric, and Wendy just can't seem to keep their magical 3-Color Room clean. Uh-oh, here comes Aunty! Quick, everyone scrambles to tidy up. But guess what? Hiding your mess isn\u2019t the same as cleaning it! \ud83e\udd2d\n\nAunty has a funny way of knowing what's hidden, and she threatens to take away all their favorite things\u2014slime for Ellie, video games for Eric, and books for Wendy.\n\nThe kids start cleaning but get easily distracted. Eric's hungry, Wendy finds a long-lost board game, and Ellie reveals a yummy Chocolate Mold Smash Cake \ud83c\udf82! As they play and eat, they forget about their main mission: Cleaning.\n\nFinally, they hear Aunty again and realize they have to wrap it up! But wait, a slime explosion \ud83c\udf08\ud83d\udca5 happens and the room is messier than before. Time is ticking, and Aunty is on her way upstairs!\n\nDo they manage to clean up in time? Well, almost! Aunty finds out and gives them a second chance. The kids team up, clean properly, and even learn a valuable lesson about responsibility and teamwork.\n\nLesson Learned:\nTeamwork makes the dream work! And cleaning up your mess responsibly is better than hiding it. \ud83d\ude09\n\nSubscribe for notifications to new videos: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCgFXm4TI8htWmCyJ6cVPG_A?sub_confirmation=1\n\nCheck out our latest videos playlist: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsHnS3mZglg&list=PL5gq3QGk5j3hRwpMNKQ9L5NyUt3FiTmSy"
