Its relations with the rest of the world appear to be thawing after last year\u2019s \u2018rocket man\u2019 nuclear missile crisis but does this mean anything is actually changing inside this hermit kingdom? Unreported World joined a business trip aimed at attracting foreign investment just as the country prepared to celebrate its 70th anniversary. Included in Marcel Theroux\u2019s tour is a visit to what North Korea has described as its \u2018Benidorm\u2019, the Wonson beach resort, and the country\u2019s only ski resort. But his highlight is a seat at the first Mass Games, the largest choreographed gymnastics event in the world in the world\u2019s biggest stadium, taking place for the first time in five years. The theme of the Games is peace but did he believe the country is really opening up?\n\n00:24:06 North Korea's Reality Stars\nUnreported World explores the new genre of primetime TV shows gripping South Korea: 'Defector TV'. For more than half a century North Korea has remained the most closed-off, repressive regime on the planet, fuelling fear and propaganda in South Korea. Now, some of the 30,000 North Korean defectors are finding fame and celebrity on \u2018Defector TV' shows and social media by revealing the truth about life under the Kim dynasty.

Its relations with the rest of the world appear to be thawing after last year\u2019s \u2018rocket man\u2019 nuclear missile crisis but does this mean anything is actually changing inside this hermit kingdom? Unreported World joined a business trip aimed at attracting foreign investment just as the country prepared to celebrate its 70th anniversary. Included in Marcel Theroux\u2019s tour is a visit to what North Korea has described as its \u2018Benidorm\u2019, the Wonson beach resort, and the country\u2019s only ski resort. But his highlight is a seat at the first Mass Games, the largest choreographed gymnastics event in the world in the world\u2019s biggest stadium, taking place for the first time in five years. The theme of the Games is peace but did he believe the country is really opening up?\n\n00:24:06 North Korea's Reality Stars\nUnreported World explores the new genre of primetime TV shows gripping South Korea: 'Defector TV'. For more than half a century North Korea has remained the most closed-off, repressive regime on the planet, fuelling fear and propaganda in South Korea. Now, some of the 30,000 North Korean defectors are finding fame and celebrity on \u2018Defector TV' shows and social media by revealing the truth about life under the Kim dynasty. Other defectors-cum-activists are funnelling information in and out across the border in an attempt to undermine Kim Jong-un\u2019s grip on power. Seyi Rhodes investigates what is being coined \u2018The Information War\u2019. At every turn this film will reflect what's really happening inside the secret state of North Korea.\n\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\nSubscribe Free Documentary Channel for free: https://bit.ly/2YJ4XzQ\nInstagram: https://instagram.com/free.documentary/\nFacebook: https://bit.ly/2QfRxbG\nTwitter: https://bit.ly/2QlwRiI\n\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\n#FreeDocumentary #Documentary #northkorea \n\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\nFree Documentary is dedicated to bringing high-class documentaries to you on YouTube for free with the latest camera equipment used by well-known filmmakers working for famous production studios.

Subscribe: https://ab.co/3yqPOZ5\nMarriage and childbirth rates are falling, as more and more young Japanese choose to stay single and childless. Relationships are too difficult, they say.\n\nIn the country\u2019s last Fertility Survey, figures showed that a quarter of women in their 30s were single, and half of those weren\u2019t interested in having a relationship. \n\nMany Japanese adults aren\u2019t even having sex. It\u2019s estimated around 10% of people in their 30s are still virgins.\n \nBy 2040, it\u2019s estimated nearly half of Japan\u2019s population will be single.\nCorrespondent Jake Sturmer has reported from the ABC\u2019s Tokyo bureau for 4 years and nothing has confounded him more than this social crisis.\nAs he prepares to return to Australia, Jake sets out on a final journey to discover the forces driving this \u2018Solo Society\u2019.\n\nHe meets 29-year-old Sayaka, who works in the fashion industry. Sayaka is happily single, and not interested in getting married. \n\n\u201cI\u2019m under a lot of (social) pressure but I don\u2019t mind,\u201d she says. \u201cThere's nothing I can\u2019t do without a man at the moment.\u201d\n\nInstead, the objects of her affection are her dogs - Kogemaru, Unimaru, Rinmaru and Riko - whom she loves to spoil.\n\nNaoya, a 32-year-old creative director for an advertising company, isn\u2019t in a rush to get married either.

He\u2019s what\u2019s called a hikikomori, someone who withdrawn socially. \n\nIn Japan there are more than a million hikikomori. Jake meets the mother of one who\u2019s become an activist, campaigning for Japanese society to be more tolerant of those who don\u2019t fit the mould.\n\n\u201cPeople believe they need to change the people who\u2019ve withdrawn but I think it\u2019s exactly the opposite. I think the society should change,\u201d she says.\n\nJake spends time with Masatomi, a cleaner whose job is to clear out the homes of those who die alone. Each year, tens of thousands of Japanese end their lives alone, their bodies often found after neighbours detect an odour. Masatomi is calling for Japanese people to sit up and take notice.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s something that could happen to anybody including myself. I strongly feel that we need to have connections with other people. I feel outrage, why don\u2019t they see what\u2019s going on?\"\n\nAbout Foreign Correspondent: \nForeign Correspondent is the prime-time international public affairs program on Australia's national broadcaster, ABC-TV.

Save the Children have been in Ukraine since 2014, and are on the ground near the Ukrainian border providing people with life-saving assistance as they flee the conflict. Please donate, every little bit counts.\n\nThis is Putin\u2019s war and to understand it you have to look at the story Putin tells himself and the Russian people that helped justify this invasion. In this video I explore Putin\u2019s motive and make the case that Russia has already lost this war.\n\nThank you to the excellent reporting by: The New York Times, The BBC, Reuters, The Economist.

But despite the prices a roasted bag of single-origin coffee can reach in the world\u2019s wealthiest countries, the farmers who handpick each coffee cherry struggle to earn a profit. \n\nWe went to Kenya to find out what it takes to grow high-quality coffee, and why it\u2019s so expensive.\n\nIntro 0:00\nGrowing coffee 0:44\nHarvesting 2:01\nCommodity vs. specialty coffee 2:56\nSorting 4:23\nWashed process 5:09\nRoasting 6:46\nDrying and Milling 10:13\nThe price of coffee 11:48\n\nMORE VIDEOS FROM SO EXPENSIVE:\nWhy Pearl Lobsters Are So Expensive | So Expensive Food | Insider Business\nhttps://youtu.be/6HiWolNnhVA\nWhy Bellerby Globes Are So Expensive | So Expensive | Insider Business\nhttps://youtu.be/ymjWeQhic0s\nWhy Moroccan Rugs Are So Expensive | So Expensive | Insider Business\nhttps://youtu.be/ujYmQ5PlOAo\n\n------------------------------------------------------\n\n#Coffee #SoExpensiveFood #BusinessInsider \n\nBusiness Insider tells you all you need to know about business, finance, tech, retail, and more.\n\nVisit our homepage for the top stories of the day: https://www.businessinsider.com\nInsider Business on Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/businessinsider\nInsider Business on Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/insiderbusiness\nInsider Business on Twitter: https://www.twitter.com/businessinsider\nInsider Business on Snapchat: https://www.snapchat.com/discover/Business_Insider/5319643143\nInsider Business on TikTok: https://www.tiktok.com/@businessinsider\n\nWhy Single-Origin Coffee Is So Expensive | So Expensive Food | Insider Business"

                    "description": "This is the Red Bull RB17 \u2013 and it\u2019s much more than F1 design genius Adrian Newey\u2019s greatest hits amalgamated into a hypercar.\n\nSure, this \u00a35m, track-only spaceship has the likes of a blown diffuser and Newey\u2019s favourite Formula 1 engine configuration (a naturally aspirated V10) but the RB17 is instead what happens when Newey isn\u2019t trying to find loopholes in restrictive Formula 1 regulations. The RB17 is what happens when Newey is unleashed!\n\nThe result, the mind-blowing result, is a car (very rich) mere mortals can buy \u2013 and one that can lap a racetrack as fast as a contemporary Formula 1 car.\n\nBehind Newey is the might of Red Bull Applied Technologies, the sister company to Red Bull Racing that uses the F1 team\u2019s know-how and applies it to wider engineering challenges. As a calling card to show their expertise, the RB17 is quite something.\n\nBut enough of us telling you about it. Instead, here\u2019s the man himself, interviewed by Top Gear\u2019s Editor-at-Large, Jason Barlow\u2026\n\nSubscribe to Top Gear for more videos: http://bit.ly/SubscribeToTopGear\n\nWATCH MORE TOP GEAR:\nFirst Looks: https://bit.ly/TGFirstLooks\u00a0\nFirst Drives: https://bit.ly/TGFirstDrives\nAmerican Tuned ft.

                        "description": "This is the Red Bull RB17 \u2013 and it\u2019s much more than F1 design genius Adrian Newey\u2019s greatest hits amalgamated into a hypercar.\n\nSure, this \u00a35m, track-only spaceship has the likes of a blown diffuser and Newey\u2019s favourite Formula 1 engine configuration (a naturally aspirated V10) but the RB17 is instead what happens when Newey isn\u2019t trying to find loopholes in restrictive Formula 1 regulations. The RB17 is what happens when Newey is unleashed!\n\nThe result, the mind-blowing result, is a car (very rich) mere mortals can buy \u2013 and one that can lap a racetrack as fast as a contemporary Formula 1 car.\n\nBehind Newey is the might of Red Bull Applied Technologies, the sister company to Red Bull Racing that uses the F1 team\u2019s know-how and applies it to wider engineering challenges. As a calling card to show their expertise, the RB17 is quite something.\n\nBut enough of us telling you about it. Instead, here\u2019s the man himself, interviewed by Top Gear\u2019s Editor-at-Large, Jason Barlow\u2026\n\nSubscribe to Top Gear for more videos: http://bit.ly/SubscribeToTopGear\n\nWATCH MORE TOP GEAR:\nFirst Looks: https://bit.ly/TGFirstLooks\u00a0\nFirst Drives: https://bit.ly/TGFirstDrives\nAmerican Tuned ft.

All the activities can be enjoyed, you can experience different occupations, you can go everywhere... All the unknowns are interesting: what will be in space? Are there aliens on earth?...

After a bumpy landing, our three friends set foot on a wasteland strewn with all kinds of objects, to the great delight for Mr Clever. But what a disappointment when he realizes that he is on a public rubbish dump, only a hundred yards from his own house!\n\nEP62 - Little miss chatterbox finds her calling - 06:00 - 10:59\n\nMr Happy thinks he has had a good idea in hiring Little Miss Chatterbox as prompter in his theatre. But this isn\u2019t at all to the liking of the actors, who can hardly say a word without Little Miss Chatterbox cutting them off in their prime. Finally, the three actors walk out in a huff and it\u2019s Little Miss Chatterbox who takes over their roles. Ger performance is so spectacular, but such a strain on the vocal chords, that she ends up losing her voice!\n\nEP63 - Mr skinny incredible bet - 12:00 - 16:56\n\nMr Skinny has laid a bet that he can get fatter than Mr Greedy, but try as he might; he is incapable of eating more. He then has a brainwave and asks Mr Tickle to call on Mr Greedy and tickle him every time he is about to eat. Several days later, Mr Greedy is indeed thinner than Mr Skinny. Mr Skinny has finally won his bet, but not as we might have imagined!\n\nEP64 - Little miss busy, d.i.y. teacher - 18:00 - 22:59\n\nLittle Miss Busy gets bored as soon as she has nothing to do. So she decides to found a D.I.Y. school. But trying to teach pupils like Mr Bump, Mr Clumsy, Mr Dizzy, Mr Lazy and Mr Silly how to build a house is by no means an easy task! But not for the radiant Little Miss Busy, who is delighted at having her work cut out with such unpromising pupils!\n\nEP65 - Little miss chatterbox goes to sea-town - 24:00 - 29:02\n\nLittle Miss Chatterbox is on holiday at Sea-town. Whilst walking on the beach one day, she meets Mr Grumpy and Little Miss Busy, who are preparing to participate in the big regatta with their sailing boat. Little Miss Chatterbox immediately climbs on board, without giving them time to object. But there isn\u2019t the tiniest puff of wind and Mr Grumpy has given up all hope of winning. That is, until Little Miss busy has the bright idea of encouraging Little Miss Chatterbox to talk and talk, which makes more than enough air to allow our three friends to win the regatta!",

And so, he finds himself back in the sewer again\u2026 but thanks to Mr Messy, who shows him which pipe leads to the village square, Mr Skinny\u2019s surprise appearance makes him the star of the party!\n\nEP44 - That's gratitude, Mr Uppity! - 18:00 - 22:59\n\nMr Uppity is always very unpleasant with everyone but, when he finds himself in hospital following a bad fall, his friends Little Miss Splendid, Mr Mischief and Mr Greedy do their utmost to look after him. And to everyone\u2019s great surprise, he says\u2026 \u201cThank you\u201d, for the first time in his life!\n\nEP45 - Little Miss Neat sees spots - 24:00 - 29:02\n\nLittle Miss Neat invites Mr Clumsy to lunch but no sooner has he arrived than he trips up and spills the cup of hot chocolate he is carrying. Little Miss Neat spends the whole day scrubbing her flat to get rid of the stains but to no avail; they refuse to budge!\nBut luckily, Mr Fussy points out that the stains aren\u2019t on the walls but\u2026 on her glasses!"

As she\u2019s leaving her house, the lottery ticket is swept out of the window by an unfortunate gust of wind before falling into the hands of Mr Mean who, though very mean, is certainly not dishonest! E runs to give it back to Little Miss Tidy who, as a reward but mainly because she doesn\u2019t know where to put all that money without making a mess\u2026 gives him the lottery ticket!\n\nEP55 - Mr Dizzy promises the moon - 24:00 - 29:02\n\nMr Dizzy has taken it into his head to promise the moon to the little children; but what a difficult promise to keep!
