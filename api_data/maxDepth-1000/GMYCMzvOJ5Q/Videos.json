                    "description": "In this TEDx Talk, Andrew Lindley explores the transformative potential of failure and shares personal anecdotes to illustrate how resilience can turn setbacks into stepping stones. Lindley provides actionable strategies and mindset shifts to help individuals navigate challenges and emerge stronger from their failures. Andrew Lindley's success in life hasn't always happened according to plan. Having his first child, Isaiah, when he was just 18 quickly changed his chosen career path that would have led him to the US Army. Instead, the start of a much different path began without a firm destination. That lifelong experience of embracing whatever comes next has helped shape his philosophy on life and the ideas that he has to share with the world. \n\nAndrew's vast professional career spans industries from mining and technology education to executive leadership. Currently Andrew is serving as Chief Information Officer for Vensure Employer Services and regularly travels to the company's offices in Phoenix, Atlanta, and Medellin, Colombia. Beyond his profession, Andrew is driven by a passion for music, learning, running, and the pursuit of a more perfect life through self knowledge and reflection. In the summer he's usually enjoying trail running or listening to live music under the Big Sky in Montana. This talk was given at a TEDx event using the TED conference format but independently organized by a local community. Learn more at https://www.ted.com/tedx",

                        "description": "In this TEDx Talk, Andrew Lindley explores the transformative potential of failure and shares personal anecdotes to illustrate how resilience can turn setbacks into stepping stones. Lindley provides actionable strategies and mindset shifts to help individuals navigate challenges and emerge stronger from their failures. Andrew Lindley's success in life hasn't always happened according to plan. Having his first child, Isaiah, when he was just 18 quickly changed his chosen career path that would have led him to the US Army. Instead, the start of a much different path began without a firm destination. That lifelong experience of embracing whatever comes next has helped shape his philosophy on life and the ideas that he has to share with the world. \n\nAndrew's vast professional career spans industries from mining and technology education to executive leadership. Currently Andrew is serving as Chief Information Officer for Vensure Employer Services and regularly travels to the company's offices in Phoenix, Atlanta, and Medellin, Colombia. Beyond his profession, Andrew is driven by a passion for music, learning, running, and the pursuit of a more perfect life through self knowledge and reflection. In the summer he's usually enjoying trail running or listening to live music under the Big Sky in Montana.

In a truly honest talk, maybe brutally honest, Mr. Blanton convinced the audience that honesty, and not politeness or political correctness is the essence of human relationships and a fulfilled life. Maybe being radically honest all the time is difficult to accept, maybe it is even an idea that a lot of people cannot digest but it is surely an idea that at least has to be intellectually entertained.",

                        "description": "This talk was given at a local TEDx event, produced independently of the TED Conferences.\t\n\nBrad Blanton Phd. is a psychotherapist, trainer and american writer, author of the \"Radical Honesty\" bestseller, a book and a theory that challenges a fundamental and almost unchallenged belief of our society. In a truly honest talk, maybe brutally honest, Mr. Blanton convinced the audience that honesty, and not politeness or political correctness is the essence of human relationships and a fulfilled life. Maybe being radically honest all the time is difficult to accept, maybe it is even an idea that a lot of people cannot digest but it is surely an idea that at least has to be intellectually entertained."

                    "description": "Molly Bingaman has a passion for helping people see their true beauty. She founded Ladybird Styling in 2010 with the bold intent of changing the way people see themselves, their style, and their world. Through merging the language of design with elements from math and physics, she and her team of experts have created a radical new approach to styling which teaches clients to choose the clothes, hairstyle, and makeup that best represent who they are. The Ladybird method has given hundreds of women the tools to show up authentically in their wardrobes and in their lives. It has been thoroughly tested, it works every time, and is completely teachable. Molly has a BA in Fine Art from Westmont College in Santa Barbara, CA and was trained by Stacy London of TLC\u2019s What Not to Wear. Her work has been featured in Design*Sponge and Good Housekeeping Magazine as well as many other local publications. She is married and lives in Kanas City, MO with her husband and perfect dog, Piccollo. Molly Bingaman has a passion for helping people see their true beauty.

Little do they know, there is more than a little to learn through this unusual approach to protecting your\nfriends, family and finances. In this out-of-the-box TEDx talk, retired ATF Investigator and Human Lie Detector, Janine Driver cracks the detecting deception through the nonverbal hot spots of murderers.  Janine Driver is the founder, president, and lead instructor for BLUEStreak Training, an elite certification program that offers award-winning advanced communications training. BLUEStreak helps executives, sales people, and other professionals build executive presence; explode their selling skills; and create and deliver business presentations that win new business.\nJanine and her team of the world\u2019s most sought after subject matter experts have helped clients become the total leader, which ultimately led them to win billions of dollars in new business contracts. Her elite A-list clients come from a wide variety of industries. Janine has made appearances on NBC\u2019s Today, The Rachael Ray Show, and HLN. \nJanine\u2019s background includes being a federal law enforcement officer within the United States Department of Justice for 16-years, where she trained over 60,000 lawyers, judges, and law enforcement officers how to read body language and detect deception.

                    "description": "Before she can tell us how to see past what drives us nuts, Driver tells us about two important things -- that we are all in fact judgmental, and that we often suffer from inattentional blindness. Such circumstances can make us feel crazy. How do we get around it? Movement pattern analysis. Each of us has a fingerprint. Those who understand the system can tell a great deal about people by watching them move. But we can also use it. As Driver tells us, whenever something is driving her nuts, she now wiggles. It is a movement from early childhood, and one CANNOT be angry when one is wiggling. This, she tells us, can save you headaches, and more importantly, friends.\n\nJanine Driver\u2019s mission is to INSPIRE people to look at their world in a different way. Janine is the New York Times Best Selling author of You Say More Than You Think, and more recently You Can\u2019t Lie To Me, award-winning keynote speaker, and body language expert for NBC\u2019s TODAY Show. Janine is the CEO and founder of the Body Language Institute and the elite division called the Decision Profiling Group.\r\nJanine and the Body Language Institute have helped Fortune 500 clients become examples of the total leader, which ultimately led them to win millions of dollars in new business contracts.\r\n\n\nThis talk was given at a TEDx event using the TED conference format but independently organized by a local community.

                        "description": "Before she can tell us how to see past what drives us nuts, Driver tells us about two important things -- that we are all in fact judgmental, and that we often suffer from inattentional blindness. Such circumstances can make us feel crazy. How do we get around it? Movement pattern analysis. Each of us has a fingerprint. Those who understand the system can tell a great deal about people by watching them move. But we can also use it. As Driver tells us, whenever something is driving her nuts, she now wiggles. It is a movement from early childhood, and one CANNOT be angry when one is wiggling. This, she tells us, can save you headaches, and more importantly, friends.\n\nJanine Driver\u2019s mission is to INSPIRE people to look at their world in a different way. Janine is the New York Times Best Selling author of You Say More Than You Think, and more recently You Can\u2019t Lie To Me, award-winning keynote speaker, and body language expert for NBC\u2019s TODAY Show. Janine is the CEO and founder of the Body Language Institute and the elite division called the Decision Profiling Group.\r\nJanine and the Body Language Institute have helped Fortune 500 clients become examples of the total leader, which ultimately led them to win millions of dollars in new business contracts.\r\n\n\nThis talk was given at a TEDx event using the TED conference format but independently organized by a local community.

She became a neuroscience nerd, studying how the brain works and how to build rapport with people. She has since worked with organizations to use persuasive communication to increase their performance, productivity, and profit, and published a book about her personal research called Getting Others to Do What You Want.

                        "description": "Can you read someone\u2019s mind by looking at them? Almost. Lynne Franklin teaches you how to connect with 3 types of people by understanding how their bodies communicate. After a boy threatened to kill her with a machete, Lynne Franklin decided to learn everything she could about persuasion. She became a neuroscience nerd, studying how the brain works and how to build rapport with people. She has since worked with organizations to use persuasive communication to increase their performance, productivity, and profit, and published a book about her personal research called Getting Others to Do What You Want. In addition to her marketing and consulting work, Lynne is a member of the National Speakers Association and President-elect of its Illinois chapter.

And every small step \u2013 part of the journey to the highest peek. The hindrances along the way to self-discovery and personal growth are easy to overcome. Learn how from his talk. For more than 30 years, Master Shi Heng Yi has been studying and practicing the interaction between mind and body. His strength is the ability to smoothly combine this knowledge with physical exercises and to practice Martial art \u2013Kung Fu and Qi Gong. He has an academic background but he prefers to live at the Shaolin Temple Europe, Monastery located in Otterberg, Germany. Since 2010 he has been taking care of the settlement and he personifies the sustainable development and spreading the Shaolin culture and philosophy. As a contemporary monk, Master Yi holds a smartphone in the folds of his clothes as he sees no contradiction between living together with ancient knowledge and high technology. \u201cThe universal law of being successful and happy at the same time means finding the balance\u201d, says master Yi.  And as for flying \u2013 yes, he really can do it! He only needs a stick and a little space. We expect him to fly-in and share about the Shaolin way at TEDxVitosha 2020. \n\n\nArtist:                   Secret Garden\nAlbum:                Earthsongs\nTrack:                   Lotus\n\n\nThis talk was given at a TEDx event using the TED conference format but independently organized by a local community.

On the other hand, she did not have the conditions to work outside the house and found herself in a tight spot. But she did not give up on her dream.\n\nUntil finally, (upon receiving a small gift from her wife), a great idea was sparked in her mind.\n\nNahid Zeraati found that little spark with her heart and soul and nurtured it until it gradually turned into a warm and lively flame. In this way, the first Niavaran leather workshop started working in the corner of their bedroom.

                    "description": "Attorney Marilyn York owns a Men\u2019s Rights Family Law Firm in Reno Nevada, established in 2001. She and her ten female employees focus on representing men for two reasons: 1. As her talk explains, fathers are crucial in the upbringing and development of their children; and 2. Fathers are the disadvantaged parent in family court and society and while the laws are improving, the statistics are not. There are currently more than 17,000,000 children growing up in America without their fathers and every year this number is growing. According to the Center for Disease Control, children from fatherless homes account for 90% of homeless and runaway children; 71% of high school dropouts and 63% of youth suicides. Listen to this talk to find out how you can help America's 17,000,000 fatherless children avoid these fates!  Marilyn D. York is a Men's Rights Divorce Attorney, licensed in California since 1998 and Nevada since 1999, where she is a Certified Family Law Specialist. Since 2001, Marilyn has owned her law firm in Reno, Nevada, where she and her 9 female employees specifically represent men in divorce and family law battles. Marilyn chose her career because of her passion for children and relationships but most of all, Marilyn is driven to help underdogs. While the laws are improving for men, not all laws are yet gender equal and the interpretation and enforcement of those that are, have a long way to go. Despite her focus on representing men, Marilyn has a deep compassion for women in need as well. It isn't lost on Marilyn that women remain disadvantaged outside Family Court. She serves that need as Board President for a local housing program for homeless young women, Nevada Youth Empowerment Project, or NYEP.

                    "description": "By facing long-held assumptions, one woman reevaluates her own gender biases. Documentary Filmmaker, The Red Pill \n\nCassie Jaye founded Jaye Bird Productions in 2008, which has since produced a  collection  of documentary films that have been praised for being thought-provoking, entertaining and respectful in representing multiple competing views within each film. Jaye is known for tackling complex and often controversial subject matters. Her latest film is  The Red Pill. Prior to  \u201cThe Red Pill\u201d, Jaye\u2019s most notable films were  the award winning feature documentaries \u201cDaddy I Do\u201d (which examined the Abstinence-Only Movement versus Comprehensive Sex Education) and \u201cThe Right to Love: An American Family\u201d (which followed one family\u2019s activism fighting for same-sex marriage rights in California). Both films showed that Jaye\u2019s interview style is to allow people to share their views honestly, openly and candidly while allowing audiences to come to  their own conclusions.\nhttp://theredpillmovie.com/about-the-filmmaker/\n\n~~\n\nThis talk was given at a TEDx event using the TED conference format but independently organized by a local community.

                        "description": "By facing long-held assumptions, one woman reevaluates her own gender biases. Documentary Filmmaker, The Red Pill \n\nCassie Jaye founded Jaye Bird Productions in 2008, which has since produced a  collection  of documentary films that have been praised for being thought-provoking, entertaining and respectful in representing multiple competing views within each film. Jaye is known for tackling complex and often controversial subject matters. Her latest film is  The Red Pill. Prior to  \u201cThe Red Pill\u201d, Jaye\u2019s most notable films were  the award winning feature documentaries \u201cDaddy I Do\u201d (which examined the Abstinence-Only Movement versus Comprehensive Sex Education) and \u201cThe Right to Love: An American Family\u201d (which followed one family\u2019s activism fighting for same-sex marriage rights in California). Both films showed that Jaye\u2019s interview style is to allow people to share their views honestly, openly and candidly while allowing audiences to come to  their own conclusions.\nhttp://theredpillmovie.com/about-the-filmmaker/\n\n~~\n\nThis talk was given at a TEDx event using the TED conference format but independently organized by a local community.
