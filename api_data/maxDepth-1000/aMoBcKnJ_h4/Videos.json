                    "description": "Every now and then, you get to witness a run of cutting-edge performance that defines an era of the sport. Even rarer, is when you see that purple patch unfold in an area that's not in the media spotlight and is renowned for sandbag grading. This past summer, saw Aidan Roberts climb not just a couple of outstanding Lakeland boulder projects, but a whole slew of FAs and repeats up to 8C+/V16 in just a six week period. We're also not talking of lines ignored by the best - they'd already seen attention - they are problems that climb some of the proudest boulder faces in the Lakes and show off the best of British climbing.  \n\nThis film follows Aidan repeating multiple 8Bs to then establishing first ascents all the way up to 8C and 8C+ with Superpowers and Outliers. Whilst you all know these grades have been climbed before elsewhere, you may not know the context of Aidan and the Lakeland grading - he's not soft and neither are the grades! One of his FAs from Colorado established previously (Railway, 8C) has been tried by some of the world's best boulderers and yet has only had a single repeat by Matt Fultz...\n\n\"World Class\" also dives into interviews to get the opinions and experiences of two of Aidan's close allies - and also elite boulderers - Dan Varian and Jack Palmieri. Both of them explain the significance of this run of climbing form and provide the perfect contextual backdrop to some stunning climbing footage. If anyone's opinion on British bouldering matters, it's these guys. They've both established and repeated hundreds of Font 8As and above, all over the UK and have watched Aidan progress in his climbing. \n\nFor those of you who like tick lists, the FAs in World Class are:\n\n- Superpowers 8C+ (Ladstones)\n- Outliers 8C (Trowbarrow)\n- Railway 8C (Colorado)\n- Flip off at the Opera 8B+/C (Bowderstone)\n- Tranquilitas 8B+/C (Kentmere)\n- Copperline 8B+ (Coppermines)\n- Hathi Junior 8B (Swarthbeck Gill)\n- Lady of the Forest 8B (Kentmere)\n- Lad powers 8A+ (Ladstones)\n\n\nFind out more about our Lattice Training Plans here: https://latticetraining.com/plans/\n\nDownload the Lattice Training app:\nApp store: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.mylatticetraining.app&hl=en_GB&gl=US\nGoogle Play: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.mylatticetraining.app&hl=en_GB&gl=US",

Some of the specific details remain uncertain, with different plausible scenarios having been given about different climbers' timing and actions, when reported later via survivors' eyewitness accounts or via radio communications of climbers who died (sometimes minutes) later in the course of events on K2 that day.\n\nThe main problem was reported as an ice avalanche occurring at an area known as \"the Bottleneck\", which destroyed many of the climbers' rope lines.

Many great mountaineers became obsessed with reaching its summit, not all of them lived to tell of their adventures. Capturing the depth of their obsession, the heart-stopping tension of the climb and delving into the controversy that still surrounds the first ascent, Mick Conefrey delivers the definitive account of the \u2018Savage Mountain\u2019.\n\nFrom drug-addicted occultist Aleister Crowley to the brilliant but tortured expedition leader Charlie Houston and, later, the Italian duo who finally made it to the top, Conefrey resurrects the tragic heroes, eccentric dreamers and uncompromising rivalries forever instilled in K2\u2019s legacy. This is the riveting, groundbreaking story of the world\u2019s deadliest mountain.\n\nFeaturing:\nLino Lacedelli, Achille Compagnoni, Pete Schoening, Charlie Houston, Bob Bates, Ed Webster, Bill Putnam, Dudley Rochester, Bob Craig, George Bell, Tony Streather, Dee Molenaar.\nProduced by Mark Conefrey \n\nStart your high-altitude adventures by climbing Kilimanjaro with us! www.ClimbKili.com \n\n#k2 #k2documentary",

                    "description": "BBC explores a history of one of the world's most challenging mountains, the Eiger, and its infamous North Face. The film gets to the heart of one of Europe's most notorious peaks, exploring its character and its impact on the people who climb it and live in its awesome shadow.\n\n---Sam Wollaston Review---\nMountains don't get much better than the Eiger with its legendary north face, a near vertical mile of rock and ice, haunted by savage winds and the ghosts of dead climbers. \"Every ledge of the Eiger is covered in the sediment of history,\" says the mountaineer Stephen Venables, who is unusually forthcoming for a climber and has a lovely way with words. He was good on the the BBC's live rock climb in the Outer Hebrides last weekend (five hours of nail-biting drama).\n\nMore than 60 people have died attempting the Eiger's north face. Most agonising was the death of the German Toni Kurz in 1936. Kurz had already seen his three companions perish around him: he'd had to cut them free to try to get himself down alive. When he was within a few feet of a rescue party, all he had to do was detach himself from the rope and he would have fallen to them and been saved. But after a night dangling alone on the rock, he was too exhausted and frostbitten to summon up the energy. \"I can't go on,\" he gasped, and died.\n\nHis would-be rescuers had emerged on to the wall from a door called the Stollenloch, which connects to the railway inside the mountain. That door is an extraordinary thing: it turns the north face of the Eiger into an advent calendar \u2013 albeit a one-hit one. To the climbers who have used the Stollenloch as an escape route, it must have felt like Christmas Day. There can be few doors \u2013 the one on the wardrobe on the way to Narnia perhaps, and possibly the Pearly Gates \u2013 that are so different on either side. On one side is one of the most extreme and terrifying places on earth, once described by the aristocratic British editor of the Alpine Journal as \"an obsession for the mentally deranged\" and \"the most imbecile variant since mountaineering first began\"; and on the other side are trainloads of tourists, on their way to see the view.\n\nToday, mountain guides Kenton Cool and Neil Brodie are going the other way, from inside to out, just to have a look. \"Bugger me, this is awesome,\" says one of them. See what I mean about not all climbers having Stephen Venables's way with words? The only pity about this absorbing chronicle of one of the world's great climbing challenges is that the conditions aren't right for Cool and Brodie. It would have been nice to go up with them, battling through the spindrift and the sediment of history, past the Stollenloch, the Hinterstoisser Traverse, the Flatiron, Death Bivouac, the Traverse of the Gods, the White Spider, and on to the summit. But then perhaps, in these days, when a Swiss wunderkind called Ueli Steck can scale the north face on his own in two hours and 47 minutes, it's quite reassuring that the mountain can still sometimes win.\n\n#Eiger #ClimbingTheEiger",

That door is an extraordinary thing: it turns the north face of the Eiger into an advent calendar \u2013 albeit a one-hit one. To the climbers who have used the Stollenloch as an escape route, it must have felt like Christmas Day. There can be few doors \u2013 the one on the wardrobe on the way to Narnia perhaps, and possibly the Pearly Gates \u2013 that are so different on either side. On one side is one of the most extreme and terrifying places on earth, once described by the aristocratic British editor of the Alpine Journal as \"an obsession for the mentally deranged\" and \"the most imbecile variant since mountaineering first began\"; and on the other side are trainloads of tourists, on their way to see the view.\n\nToday, mountain guides Kenton Cool and Neil Brodie are going the other way, from inside to out, just to have a look. \"Bugger me, this is awesome,\" says one of them. See what I mean about not all climbers having Stephen Venables's way with words? The only pity about this absorbing chronicle of one of the world's great climbing challenges is that the conditions aren't right for Cool and Brodie. It would have been nice to go up with them, battling through the spindrift and the sediment of history, past the Stollenloch, the Hinterstoisser Traverse, the Flatiron, Death Bivouac, the Traverse of the Gods, the White Spider, and on to the summit. But then perhaps, in these days, when a Swiss wunderkind called Ueli Steck can scale the north face on his own in two hours and 47 minutes, it's quite reassuring that the mountain can still sometimes win.\n\n#Eiger #ClimbingTheEiger"

Between historic (and controversial) FAs like The Nose of El Capitan\u00a0and The Dawn Wall, Harding presided over epic benders at the Lower Sierra Eating, Drinking and Farcing Society, \"founded on the principles of gluttony and sloth.\u201d\u00a0\n\nWe teamed up with Jungmaven to create this limited-release hemp tee paying homage to Harding's vision: https://reelrocktour.com/products/warren-harding-tee\n\nA portion of each purchase will go to the YCA (Yosemite Climbing Association), the non-profit responsible for Yosemite's annual Facelift event and the new Yosemite Climbing Museum. \n\nThis story is adapted from our award-winning feature documentary, Valley Uprising.

Between historic (and controversial) FAs like The Nose of El Capitan\u00a0and The Dawn Wall, Harding presided over epic benders at the Lower Sierra Eating, Drinking and Farcing Society, \"founded on the principles of gluttony and sloth.\u201d\u00a0\n\nWe teamed up with Jungmaven to create this limited-release hemp tee paying homage to Harding's vision: https://reelrocktour.com/products/warren-harding-tee\n\nA portion of each purchase will go to the YCA (Yosemite Climbing Association), the non-profit responsible for Yosemite's annual Facelift event and the new Yosemite Climbing Museum. \n\nThis story is adapted from our award-winning feature documentary, Valley Uprising.

This tenuous climb, high on the sides of Snowdon was the UK's first E9. With hardly any protection, falling off from the upper sections is thought to be fatal. \n\nWhen Johnny Dawes made the first ascent in October 1986, it made headlines for being \"the world's hardest climb\"\n\nMore info on UKClimbing: https://www.ukclimbing.com/articles/features/facing_the_indian_by_johnny_dawes-5754\n\nJohnny Dawes & The story of Indian Face is a documentary about rock climbing that takes place in Clogwyn Du'r Arddu. It was directed by Alun Hughes in 2006 and produced by Hughes Film. It features Johnny Dawes, Joe Brown, Nick Dixon and John Redhead.\n\nFun Fact: Top climber James McHaffie reckons that Master's Wall was actually our first E9. He told us \"It got graded E7 but people repeated it the wrong way. And the guidebook was wrong.

                    "description": "Gerke Hoekstra is very experienced in lead rope solo climbing and tope rope solo climbing. I've been using these techniques and I love the freedom it gives me: I can work out the beta of a hard sport climbing route or climb laps on an easy route by myself and work on endurance.\n\nGerke shows is preferred method using a petzl grigri, petzl asap and petzl microtraxion, but he also shows a cheaper system using only the petzl grigri and backup knots.\nDisclaimer: rope solo is dangerous, and none of these devices are designed for it! One thing that isn't discussed is the factor 2 fall which can occur in multipitch climbing. A factor 2 fall can result in a force of 6kN and is VERY dangerous. Best thing to do is to avoid factor 2 falls. Risk management is something you should be able to do when multipitch climbing.\n\nOther resources:\nAndy Kirkpatrick: https://www.andy-kirkpatrick.com/blog/view/rope_soloing_101_part_1\n\nPetzl:\nhttps://m.petzl.com/US/en/Sport/General-principles-for-solo-climbing-with-a-fixed-belay-rope?ActivityName=Multi-pitch-climbing\n\nAnd other channels such as @HardIsEasy @WideBoyz @Pete_Whittaker and @HowNOT2 @YannCamusBlissClimbing \n\nHuge thanks to Gerke Hoekstra!

My goal for 2022 is to overcome some health issues and go from climbing 7a to climbing an 8a :)\n\nMy plan to reach 8a consists of a mental, tactical and and a physical phase. Every 2 weeks, I will evaluate my progress and check if I'm still adhering to my core values: health, virtue, resourcefulness, transparency, and growth. Progressing towards 8a must not be detrimental to my long-term health, or any of the other core values.\n\nI will share the whole journey on YouTube!

                        "description": "Gerke Hoekstra is very experienced in lead rope solo climbing and tope rope solo climbing. I've been using these techniques and I love the freedom it gives me: I can work out the beta of a hard sport climbing route or climb laps on an easy route by myself and work on endurance.\n\nGerke shows is preferred method using a petzl grigri, petzl asap and petzl microtraxion, but he also shows a cheaper system using only the petzl grigri and backup knots.\nDisclaimer: rope solo is dangerous, and none of these devices are designed for it! One thing that isn't discussed is the factor 2 fall which can occur in multipitch climbing. A factor 2 fall can result in a force of 6kN and is VERY dangerous. Best thing to do is to avoid factor 2 falls. Risk management is something you should be able to do when multipitch climbing.\n\nOther resources:\nAndy Kirkpatrick: https://www.andy-kirkpatrick.com/blog/view/rope_soloing_101_part_1\n\nPetzl:\nhttps://m.petzl.com/US/en/Sport/General-principles-for-solo-climbing-with-a-fixed-belay-rope?ActivityName=Multi-pitch-climbing\n\nAnd other channels such as @HardIsEasy @WideBoyz @Pete_Whittaker and @HowNOT2 @YannCamusBlissClimbing \n\nHuge thanks to Gerke Hoekstra!

My goal for 2022 is to overcome some health issues and go from climbing 7a to climbing an 8a :)\n\nMy plan to reach 8a consists of a mental, tactical and and a physical phase. Every 2 weeks, I will evaluate my progress and check if I'm still adhering to my core values: health, virtue, resourcefulness, transparency, and growth. Progressing towards 8a must not be detrimental to my long-term health, or any of the other core values.\n\nI will share the whole journey on YouTube! If you want to know every detail, go to AmirNickname.com to see the exact stats and schedule.\n\nFor information about falling safely while bouldering go to:\nvalcursus.nl\n\nMusic by Fesliyan studios & Ben Sound\n#rockclimbing #climbing #bouldering"

                    "description": "Chillino guide Fabi and student Stephan demonstrate the entire process of multi pitch rappelling from finishing the last pitch to rappelling down two-pitches/two-times.\n\nThe technique of using a pre-rigged rappelling system has the advantage of setting up the entire rappel system (for each climber/rappeller) in advance before the first rappeller leaves each anchor. This allows for a mutual system check as a team where everybody is present vs. each climber individually transitioning from anchor to rappelling. \n\nTransitioning from a self-equalizing anchor to a pre-rigged system is also less gear intense since it only requires the use of one (quad/self-equalizing) anchor that the first rappeller \u201cbumps\u201d down to each new rappel station/anchor. \n\nUsing a self-equalizing anchor also has the advantage that the master point equalizes automatically to a variety of different anchor bolt positions. Even though, most rappel anchors tend to be horizontally aligned and no further apart than 45cm/18 inches, there is always a slight difference in bolt positions for each anchor (further apart horizontally and vertically). A self-equalizing anchor, such as the \u201cquad\u201d, has the characteristics to compensate for these differences and create an equalized master point.\n\nUsing a pre-rigged system in combination with a self-equalizing anchor (quad) also avoids inconvenient clipping into tight rappel rings/chains or hangers that are crowded with multiple carabiners at chains and hangers.\n\nFor pre-rigged rappelling we use an extension (PAS) to attach our rappel device to the harness. In most cases, the added distance between harness and rappel device creates enough room to not be pulled on by movement that is caused by the rappelling climber. If using a friction hitch back-up (as the second, 3rd or 4th rappeller), make sure to attach it to the brake strands after the tension has been taken off the rappel line/s \u2013 in order to not be inconveniently pulled by your friction hitch. Or ask your partner for a fireman\u2019s backup (as demonstrated in the video).\n\nThe handling of an extended rappel device (with PAS) also tends to be more comfortable as it allows rappellers to hold their hands on the brake strands right in front of the chest (vs. lower than waist when not extnded). Also, an extended rappel device lowers the risk of getting \u201cstuff\u201d (such as, hair,..) stucked in the rappel device.",
