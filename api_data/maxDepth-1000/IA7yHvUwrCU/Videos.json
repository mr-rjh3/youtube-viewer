But swimming has been banned in the Seine for a century because the Paris sewer system is designed to dump wastewater into the river during heavy rain, when the sewers get overwhelmed by stormwater. \n\nWhen that happens, levels of E. coli, a bacteria associated with fecal matter, spike in the river, making it too contaminated to swim in. In order to make good on its promise to clean the river, Paris officials took on a $1.5 billion USD infrastructure project that includes a massive underground tank and tunnel system meant to hold excess sewage during heavy rain and prevent further contamination of the Seine. \n\nWater quality testing will be done daily ahead of the Olympic games this summer, and Paris officials are hopeful their ambitious plan to host swimming in the famously polluted river will succeed. \n\nFollow the daily water quality tests of the Seine from the City of Paris here: \nhttps://www.paris.fr/pages/meteo-de-la-seine-quelle-est-la-qualite-de-l-eau-du-fleuve-27467\n\nCheck out some of the data used in this video, along with additional water quality tests, from Fluidion:\nhttps://fluidion.com/open-data-initiative/2024-seine-water-quality\n\nAre Olympians Going to Swim in Poop Water? \u2013 The Cut\nhttps://www.thecut.com/article/olympics-2024-athletes-swim-unsanitary-seine-river.html\n\nWill the Seine be ready for Olympic swimming?

In order to make good on its promise to clean the river, Paris officials took on a $1.5 billion USD infrastructure project that includes a massive underground tank and tunnel system meant to hold excess sewage during heavy rain and prevent further contamination of the Seine. \n\nWater quality testing will be done daily ahead of the Olympic games this summer, and Paris officials are hopeful their ambitious plan to host swimming in the famously polluted river will succeed. \n\nFollow the daily water quality tests of the Seine from the City of Paris here: \nhttps://www.paris.fr/pages/meteo-de-la-seine-quelle-est-la-qualite-de-l-eau-du-fleuve-27467\n\nCheck out some of the data used in this video, along with additional water quality tests, from Fluidion:\nhttps://fluidion.com/open-data-initiative/2024-seine-water-quality\n\nAre Olympians Going to Swim in Poop Water? \u2013 The Cut\nhttps://www.thecut.com/article/olympics-2024-athletes-swim-unsanitary-seine-river.html\n\nWill the Seine be ready for Olympic swimming?

                        "description": "Body Bizarre is a TLC show highlighting unusual diseases people live with around the world. Today we look at a man whose body has ballooned in size because of a deep sea diving accident, a man who will die if he doesn't drink gallons of water a day, a woman with a highly-dangerous skin pigmentation issue, gigantism affecting the fertility of a Brazilian couple, and a young Chinese boy whose body always feels hungry no matter how much he's eaten. As always, these conditions are real, so let's lead with empathy and understanding in the comment section.\n\nI LOVE reading your comments and take your suggestions seriously. If there\u2019s a subject you want me to discuss or something you\u2019d like for me to react to, leave a comment down below. Many of my videos have been born out of suggestions directly from you, so don\u2019t hold back!\n-Doctor Mike Varshavski\n\nHelp us continue the fight against medical misinformation and change the world through charity by becoming a Doctor Mike Resident on Patreon where every month I donate 100% of the proceeds to the charity, organization, or cause of your choice!

You will recognize most of these higher-order multiples, but there are a few really interesting, lesser known as well. And YOU WILL BE SHOCKED at how corrupt the doctor behind Octomom was.\n\n*The image at 6:17 is incorrectly labeled as Ann Lawson and her first husband, Sam. The image actually shows Ann and her second husband, Gary.\n\nPortions of this video were edited by Maktoob Saad and Mackenzie Burke.

The condition severely impacts the shape of Maddie\u2019s head, and she\u2019s undergone many surgeries on her skull. Pfeiffer Syndrome 2 also means she has speech and hearing issues. Her mother Rachael is a solo parent, totally dedicated to her daughter, trying her best to give Maddie as normal a childhood as possible. Maddie has recently started at a very supportive school. While she struggles with her physical limitations due to difficulties with her balance, she loves to play like any other kid. Maddie is desperate to try out riding a bike. Her fragile skull means she can\u2019t risk riding without proper head protection. However, Rachael\u2019s been unable to find a bike helmet on the market that fits Maddie\u2019s unusually shaped head. Now a design lab at Auckland University has offered to help. The lab will try making a custom helmet for Maddie using sophisticated 3D mapping and printing technology. Could this be the solution to get Maddie out wheeling?\n\nFollow Us on Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/attitudetv\nFollow Us on Twitter: https://twitter.com/attitude_tv\nSee more Videos: https://www.attitudelive.com\n\nMade with funding from NZ on Air https://www.tiktok.com/@attitudepictures",

                        "description": "Maddie Blitvich is a bright, and lively seven-year-old who lives with Pfeiffer Syndrome 2, a rare genetic condition. The condition severely impacts the shape of Maddie\u2019s head, and she\u2019s undergone many surgeries on her skull. Pfeiffer Syndrome 2 also means she has speech and hearing issues. Her mother Rachael is a solo parent, totally dedicated to her daughter, trying her best to give Maddie as normal a childhood as possible. Maddie has recently started at a very supportive school. While she struggles with her physical limitations due to difficulties with her balance, she loves to play like any other kid. Maddie is desperate to try out riding a bike. Her fragile skull means she can\u2019t risk riding without proper head protection. However, Rachael\u2019s been unable to find a bike helmet on the market that fits Maddie\u2019s unusually shaped head. Now a design lab at Auckland University has offered to help. The lab will try making a custom helmet for Maddie using sophisticated 3D mapping and printing technology. Could this be the solution to get Maddie out wheeling?\n\nFollow Us on Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/attitudetv\nFollow Us on Twitter: https://twitter.com/attitude_tv\nSee more Videos: https://www.attitudelive.com\n\nMade with funding from NZ on Air https://www.tiktok.com/@attitudepictures"

                    "description": "NOTE FROM TED: Please do not look to this talk as a substitute for medical advice. This talk only represents the speaker's personal views and understanding of hormones and mental health, which some viewers may find alienating. We've flagged this talk because it falls outside the content guidelines TED gives TEDx organizers. TEDx events are independently organized by volunteers. The guidelines we give TEDx organizers are described in more detail here: http://storage.ted.com/tedx/manuals/tedx_content_guidelines.pdf\n\nMenopause and ADHD appear to collide for many women, creating confusing cognitive challenges with both shrouded in misunderstanding, misdiagnosis and a sea of misfiring hormones.  Is it time to rethink the perception of ADHD as a naughty boy\u2019s disorder and start looking more deeply at the impact of falling oestrogen levels on dopamine regulation in perimenopausal women.\n \n After a 32 year career with the Ministry of Defence, Bev Thorogood found herself unable to cope with the demands of her full-time job as brain fog, anxiety and low self-confidence left her physically and emotionally burnt out.  Making the decision to resign at the age of 52, she has gone on to build a successful business partnering with organisations including Channel 4, The Royal Air Force, Southampton University and The London Clinic among many others, to raise awareness of the impact of menopause on working women. Currently coming to terms with the realisation that at the age of 56 she almost certainly has undiagnosed ADHD, she\u2019s found herself falling down a brand new and rather terrifying rabbit hole where menopause and neurodiversity have crossed paths creating a whole new world of questions and a distinct lack of answers. This talk was given at a TEDx event using the TED conference format but independently organized by a local community. Learn more at https://www.ted.com/tedx",

                        "description": "NOTE FROM TED: Please do not look to this talk as a substitute for medical advice. This talk only represents the speaker's personal views and understanding of hormones and mental health, which some viewers may find alienating. We've flagged this talk because it falls outside the content guidelines TED gives TEDx organizers. TEDx events are independently organized by volunteers. The guidelines we give TEDx organizers are described in more detail here: http://storage.ted.com/tedx/manuals/tedx_content_guidelines.pdf\n\nMenopause and ADHD appear to collide for many women, creating confusing cognitive challenges with both shrouded in misunderstanding, misdiagnosis and a sea of misfiring hormones.  Is it time to rethink the perception of ADHD as a naughty boy\u2019s disorder and start looking more deeply at the impact of falling oestrogen levels on dopamine regulation in perimenopausal women.\n \n After a 32 year career with the Ministry of Defence, Bev Thorogood found herself unable to cope with the demands of her full-time job as brain fog, anxiety and low self-confidence left her physically and emotionally burnt out.  Making the decision to resign at the age of 52, she has gone on to build a successful business partnering with organisations including Channel 4, The Royal Air Force, Southampton University and The London Clinic among many others, to raise awareness of the impact of menopause on working women. Currently coming to terms with the realisation that at the age of 56 she almost certainly has undiagnosed ADHD, she\u2019s found herself falling down a brand new and rather terrifying rabbit hole where menopause and neurodiversity have crossed paths creating a whole new world of questions and a distinct lack of answers.

An extroverted-extrovert with a penchant for social justice chats. She\u2019s wife to a darling husband, mum to two lovely boys \u2014 and a sore loser of board games.\n\nWhen Martha\u2019s not crafting delicious words, you\u2019ll find her walking two giant pooches, obsessing over her latest hobby, or wrapped around a cup of tea, planning her next Instagram reel.

                    "description": "For most people it's not a matter of if, but when, they will lose some sense of hearing. Still, we don't give hearing loss or hearing aids much thought until it happens to us--or someone we know. \n\nOnly then do we learn that hearing aids are incapable of restoring hearing to normal, especially in acoustically challenging situations. The good news is that modern technology continues to bring us new, sometimes hidden, and often unknown features that can help those with hearing loss overcome more of their hearing challenges.\n\nJuli\u00ebtte Sterkens, AuD, is an audiologist with forty years of experience in hearing rehabilitation turned consumer advocate with the Hearing Loss Association of America. She has published numerous articles and lectured internationally to consumers,  audiologists, hearing instrument specialists, and venue operators. Topics include living well with hearing loss, hearing accessibility, and hearing loops. Her work has led to hundreds of hearing loop installations in Wisconsin. She has received numerous awards for her efforts, including the American Academy of Audiology Presidential Award. She serves on the board of HEAR in the Fox Cities, a non-profit that helps pay for hearing aids for children in North-East Wisconsin.\n\nShe enjoys gardening, traveling worldwide to observe solar eclipses with her husband, and visiting her family and son in the Netherlands and daughter in Australia.

                        "description": "For most people it's not a matter of if, but when, they will lose some sense of hearing. Still, we don't give hearing loss or hearing aids much thought until it happens to us--or someone we know. \n\nOnly then do we learn that hearing aids are incapable of restoring hearing to normal, especially in acoustically challenging situations. The good news is that modern technology continues to bring us new, sometimes hidden, and often unknown features that can help those with hearing loss overcome more of their hearing challenges.\n\nJuli\u00ebtte Sterkens, AuD, is an audiologist with forty years of experience in hearing rehabilitation turned consumer advocate with the Hearing Loss Association of America. She has published numerous articles and lectured internationally to consumers,  audiologists, hearing instrument specialists, and venue operators. Topics include living well with hearing loss, hearing accessibility, and hearing loops. Her work has led to hundreds of hearing loop installations in Wisconsin. She has received numerous awards for her efforts, including the American Academy of Audiology Presidential Award. She serves on the board of HEAR in the Fox Cities, a non-profit that helps pay for hearing aids for children in North-East Wisconsin.\n\nShe enjoys gardening, traveling worldwide to observe solar eclipses with her husband, and visiting her family and son in the Netherlands and daughter in Australia.

A new discovery about which parts of the brain connect to the auditory centres is shining light on fresh pathways to future treatments. \n\nDr Kristin Barry is a research fellow at the Ear Science Institute Australia and adjunct at the University of Western Australia, with her career keenly focused on investigating the changes that occur in the brain after traumatic sound exposure. Kristin was drawn to this area of research by her fascination with the phenomenon of phantom limb perception. She has also investigated drug treatments, biomedical implants, and the use of repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation, in the treatment of hearing loss and tinnitus.

                        "description": "If you thought your tinnitus was a problem with your ears, think again--literally. A new discovery about which parts of the brain connect to the auditory centres is shining light on fresh pathways to future treatments. \n\nDr Kristin Barry is a research fellow at the Ear Science Institute Australia and adjunct at the University of Western Australia, with her career keenly focused on investigating the changes that occur in the brain after traumatic sound exposure. Kristin was drawn to this area of research by her fascination with the phenomenon of phantom limb perception. She has also investigated drug treatments, biomedical implants, and the use of repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation, in the treatment of hearing loss and tinnitus.

                    "description": "NOTE FROM TED: Please do not look to this talk for medical advice. We've flagged this talk for falling outside TEDx's curatorial guidelines. This talk represents the speaker\u2019s personal views and experiences with nutrition, mental health, and human biology. TEDx events are independently organized by volunteers. The guidelines we give TEDx organizers are described in more detail here: http://storage.ted.com/tedx/manuals/tedx_content_guidelines.pdf\n\nHealth and science journalist Max Lugavere has always been close with his mom. When she began to show signs of dementia in her early fifties, it shook him to his core. Wasn\u2019t dementia an old person\u2019s disease? And with drug trials having a near 100% failure rate, what was there to do? In 2017, a leading Alzheimer\u2019s organization recognized for the first time that one third of dementia cases may be preventable. And so Max decided to devote himself to figuring out how he and his peers could best avoid the disease. In this illuminating talk, Max discusses the fascinating diet and lifestyle changes associated with significant risk reduction for Alzheimer\u2019s disease and dementia, and what that means. For more, pick up his New York Times bestselling book, GENIUS FOODS. Max Lugavere is a filmmaker, author, and TV personality. He is the director of the upcoming film BREAD HEAD, the first-ever documentary about dementia prevention through diet and lifestyle, and is publishing his first book in early 2018 documenting his findings on how to optimize focus, productivity, mood, and long-term brain health with food. Lugavere is a regularly-appearing \"core expert\" on The Dr. Oz Show, has been featured on NBC Nightly News, in the Wall Street Journal, and has contributed as a health journalist to Medscape, Vice/Munchies, the Daily Beast, and others. He is a highly sought-after speaker and has been invited to keynote events such as the Biohacker Summit in Stockholm Sweden, and esteemed academic institutions like the New York Academy of Sciences. His newest book, GENIUS FOODS, is a New York Times best seller. This talk was given at a TEDx event using the TED conference format but independently organized by a local community.

                        "description": "NOTE FROM TED: Please do not look to this talk for medical advice. We've flagged this talk for falling outside TEDx's curatorial guidelines. This talk represents the speaker\u2019s personal views and experiences with nutrition, mental health, and human biology. TEDx events are independently organized by volunteers. The guidelines we give TEDx organizers are described in more detail here: http://storage.ted.com/tedx/manuals/tedx_content_guidelines.pdf\n\nHealth and science journalist Max Lugavere has always been close with his mom. When she began to show signs of dementia in her early fifties, it shook him to his core. Wasn\u2019t dementia an old person\u2019s disease? And with drug trials having a near 100% failure rate, what was there to do? In 2017, a leading Alzheimer\u2019s organization recognized for the first time that one third of dementia cases may be preventable. And so Max decided to devote himself to figuring out how he and his peers could best avoid the disease. In this illuminating talk, Max discusses the fascinating diet and lifestyle changes associated with significant risk reduction for Alzheimer\u2019s disease and dementia, and what that means. For more, pick up his New York Times bestselling book, GENIUS FOODS. Max Lugavere is a filmmaker, author, and TV personality. He is the director of the upcoming film BREAD HEAD, the first-ever documentary about dementia prevention through diet and lifestyle, and is publishing his first book in early 2018 documenting his findings on how to optimize focus, productivity, mood, and long-term brain health with food. Lugavere is a regularly-appearing \"core expert\" on The Dr. Oz Show, has been featured on NBC Nightly News, in the Wall Street Journal, and has contributed as a health journalist to Medscape, Vice/Munchies, the Daily Beast, and others. He is a highly sought-after speaker and has been invited to keynote events such as the Biohacker Summit in Stockholm Sweden, and esteemed academic institutions like the New York Academy of Sciences. His newest book, GENIUS FOODS, is a New York Times best seller. This talk was given at a TEDx event using the TED conference format but independently organized by a local community.

Neal Barnard, clinical researcher and founder of the Physicians Committee for Responsible Medicine (PCRM), identifies the causes of this serious issue and advises us how we can fight these statistics.\nhttp://www.nealbarnard.org/\n\nAbout TEDx, x = independently organized event\nIn the spirit of ideas worth spreading, TEDx is a program of local, self-organized events that bring people together to share a TED-like experience. At a TEDx event, TEDTalks video and live speakers combine to spark deep discussion and connection in a small group. These local, self-organized events are branded TEDx, where x = independently organized TED event. The TED Conference provides general guidance for the TEDx program, but individual TEDx events are self-organized.* (*Subject to certain rules and regulations)"
