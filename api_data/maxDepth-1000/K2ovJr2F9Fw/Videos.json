                    "description": "Automakers are offering steep discounts on electric vehicles, and especially on leases. In the first three months of 2024, less than a quarter of car buyers leased vehicles, but more than a third of EV buyers did. By May, nearly 70% of customers getting EVs through dealerships were leased. But EV leasing is problematic for carmakers. While the discounts suggest automakers could be offsetting losses in their EV businesses, the resale values are especially low for them.\n\nChapters:\n00:57 Title card: Why EVs have a leasing problem \n01:04 Chapter 1: Leasing and EVs\n02:54 Chapter 2: Consumers and leasing\n06:10 Chapter 3: Automakers and leasing\n10:02 Chapter 4: Future of EV leasing\n\nProducer: Robert Ferris\nEditor: Darren Geeter \nAnimation: Christina Locopo\nSenior Managing Producer: Tala Hadavi\nAdditional footage: Getty Images, Rivian, Tesla, Ford, GM, Hyundai, Polestar\n\n\u00bb Subscribe to CNBC: https://cnb.cx/SubscribeCNBC\n\u00bb Subscribe to CNBC TV: https://cnb.cx/SubscribeCNBCtelevision\n\nAbout CNBC: From 'Wall Street' to 'Main Street' to award winning original documentaries and Reality TV series, CNBC has you covered.

                        "description": "Automakers are offering steep discounts on electric vehicles, and especially on leases. In the first three months of 2024, less than a quarter of car buyers leased vehicles, but more than a third of EV buyers did. By May, nearly 70% of customers getting EVs through dealerships were leased. But EV leasing is problematic for carmakers. While the discounts suggest automakers could be offsetting losses in their EV businesses, the resale values are especially low for them.\n\nChapters:\n00:57 Title card: Why EVs have a leasing problem \n01:04 Chapter 1: Leasing and EVs\n02:54 Chapter 2: Consumers and leasing\n06:10 Chapter 3: Automakers and leasing\n10:02 Chapter 4: Future of EV leasing\n\nProducer: Robert Ferris\nEditor: Darren Geeter \nAnimation: Christina Locopo\nSenior Managing Producer: Tala Hadavi\nAdditional footage: Getty Images, Rivian, Tesla, Ford, GM, Hyundai, Polestar\n\n\u00bb Subscribe to CNBC: https://cnb.cx/SubscribeCNBC\n\u00bb Subscribe to CNBC TV: https://cnb.cx/SubscribeCNBCtelevision\n\nAbout CNBC: From 'Wall Street' to 'Main Street' to award winning original documentaries and Reality TV series, CNBC has you covered.

In many ways, the battleground state reflects the recent history of the GOP, with Republicans swinging more and more to the right, ending in a full-on embrace of Donald Trump\u2019s MAGA policies. A close observer of this phenomenon is Charlie Sykes, founder of The Bulwark and a respected voice amongst never-Trump Republicans. Sykes joined Walter Isaacson to analyze what cards Republicans might play in the upcoming election, and what strategies Biden might adopt, post-debate.\n\nOriginally aired on July 12, 2024\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nMajor support for Amanpour and Company is provided by The Anderson Family Endowment, Jim Attwood and Leslie Williams, Candace King Weir, the Leila and Mickey Straus Family Charitable Trust, Mark J.
