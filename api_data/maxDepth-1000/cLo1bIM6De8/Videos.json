He has practiced bushcraft and outdoor-survival skills in jungles all around the world. \n\nHe describes the best ways to escape quicksand, comparing them to Steven Spielberg's \"Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull\" (2008), starring Harrison Ford and Shia LaBeouf. He talks about hunting and fishing skills you can use in the jungle, shown in \"Embrace of the Serpent\" (2015); \"Jungle Cruise\" (2021), starring Dwayne Johnson and Emily Blunt; and \"Predator\" (1987), starring Arnold Schwarzenegger and Carl Weathers. He discusses how to find potable jungle water, as seen in \"Cast Away\" (2000), starring Tom Hanks. He breaks down how to use natural materials to make rope from \"The Jungle Book\" (2016), starring Bill Murray. He speaks on how to treat injuries, as portrayed in \"Tomb Raider\" (2018), starring Alicia Vikander. Finally, he analyzes the survival methods used to navigate jungle rapids and floods in \"Jungle\" (2017), starring Daniel Radcliffe; \"The Lost City\" (2022), starring Sandra Bullock and Channing Tatum; and \"Romancing the Stone\" (1984), starring Michael Douglas and Kathleen Turner.\n\nWATCH MORE HOW REAL IS IT VIDEOS: \nTraditional Archery Expert Rates 11 More Archers In Movies\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXxmgv_0LYc\nWeapons Masters Rate 85 Fight Scenes in Movies and TV\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOAMYgaPTmU\nMartial Arts Masters Rate 21 Fight Scenes in Movies and TV\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VuwyJ64jeYs&t=1s\n\n------------------------------------------------------\n#Insider #howrealisit #Jungle\n\nInsider is great journalism about what passionate people actually want to know.

                    "description": "Retired Col. Eric Terashima rates scenes portraying the Afghanistan War in movies. During his 30 years of service, Terashima had 12 deployments, including eight combat tours, three of which were in Afghanistan.\n\nHe discusses films that were based on real battles, like \"Lone Survivor\" (2013), starring Eric Bana, Taylor Kitsch, and Mark Wahlberg; \"12 Strong\" (2018), starring Chris Hemsworth, Michael Pe\u00f1a, and Michael Shannon; and \"The Outpost\" (2020), starring Scott Eastwood and Orlando Bloom. He talks about the vital role of interpreters during the war, as portrayed in \"The Covenant\" (2023), starring Jake Gyllenhaal. He shares the best tactics to use in shoot-outs in urban settings, shown in \"Dear John\" (2010), starring Channing Tatum and Amanda Seyfried. He describes the prevalence of improvised explosive devices in Afghanistan, as seen in \"A War\" (2015). He breaks down the roadside ambushes in \"Iron Man\" (2008), starring Robert Downey Jr.; and \"Whiskey Tango Foxtrot\" (2016), starring Tina Fey, Margot Robbie, and Billy Bob Thornton. Finally, he relates his personal experience when watching how an Afghanistan War veteran's post-traumatic stress disorder is portrayed in HBO's \"Barry\" (2018-2023), starring Bill Hader and Henry Winkler.\n\nVeterans who have been affected by PTSD can contact the PTSD Foundation of America at ptsdusa.org or the Wounded Warrior Project at woundedwarriorproject.org.\n\nMORE HOW REAL IS IT VIDEOS:\nMilitary Experts Rate 70 Military Battles In Movies And TV\nhttps://youtu.be/5hCKDPSSVi0\nJungle Survivalist Rates 10 Jungle Survivals In Movies\nhttps://youtu.be/gnqYejwwAh4\nSpecial Ops Bomb Technician Rates 11 Bomb Disposals In Movies And TV\nhttps://youtu.be/XBpb-eIrfxs\n\n------------------------------------------------------\n\n#afghanistan #howrealisit #insider \n\nInsider is great journalism about what passionate people actually want to know.

                        "description": "Retired Col. Eric Terashima rates scenes portraying the Afghanistan War in movies. During his 30 years of service, Terashima had 12 deployments, including eight combat tours, three of which were in Afghanistan.\n\nHe discusses films that were based on real battles, like \"Lone Survivor\" (2013), starring Eric Bana, Taylor Kitsch, and Mark Wahlberg; \"12 Strong\" (2018), starring Chris Hemsworth, Michael Pe\u00f1a, and Michael Shannon; and \"The Outpost\" (2020), starring Scott Eastwood and Orlando Bloom. He talks about the vital role of interpreters during the war, as portrayed in \"The Covenant\" (2023), starring Jake Gyllenhaal. He shares the best tactics to use in shoot-outs in urban settings, shown in \"Dear John\" (2010), starring Channing Tatum and Amanda Seyfried. He describes the prevalence of improvised explosive devices in Afghanistan, as seen in \"A War\" (2015). He breaks down the roadside ambushes in \"Iron Man\" (2008), starring Robert Downey Jr.; and \"Whiskey Tango Foxtrot\" (2016), starring Tina Fey, Margot Robbie, and Billy Bob Thornton. Finally, he relates his personal experience when watching how an Afghanistan War veteran's post-traumatic stress disorder is portrayed in HBO's \"Barry\" (2018-2023), starring Bill Hader and Henry Winkler.\n\nVeterans who have been affected by PTSD can contact the PTSD Foundation of America at ptsdusa.org or the Wounded Warrior Project at woundedwarriorproject.org.\n\nMORE HOW REAL IS IT VIDEOS:\nMilitary Experts Rate 70 Military Battles In Movies And TV\nhttps://youtu.be/5hCKDPSSVi0\nJungle Survivalist Rates 10 Jungle Survivals In Movies\nhttps://youtu.be/gnqYejwwAh4\nSpecial Ops Bomb Technician Rates 11 Bomb Disposals In Movies And TV\nhttps://youtu.be/XBpb-eIrfxs\n\n------------------------------------------------------\n\n#afghanistan #howrealisit #insider \n\nInsider is great journalism about what passionate people actually want to know.

He looks at the realism of urban and jungle warfare, such as the battle of Hu\u1ebf during the Tet Offensive in \"Full Metal Jacket\" (1987) and \"Platoon\" (1986), featuring Willem Dafoe, Charlie Sheen, and Johnny Depp. Allison also looks at the portrayal of the Army of the Republic of Vietnam, or ARVN, in \"M\u00f9i C\u1ecf Ch\u00e1y\" (\"The Scent of Burning Grass\") (2012) and \"The Green Berets\" (1968), starring John Wayne. Additionally, he discusses the tragedies and aftermath of the Vietnam War, connecting the M\u1ef9 Lai massacre to the civilian deaths in \"Born on the Fourth of July\" (1989), with Tom Cruise, and talking about the Vietnam War POW/MIA issue in \"Rambo: First Blood Part II\" (1985), starring Sylvester Stallone.\n\nAllison is a professor of military history at Georgia Southern University. He has written several books about the Vietnam War, including \"My Lai: An American Atrocity in the Vietnam War.\" He is also a Vietnam battlefield tour guide with the UK company The Cultural Experience.\n\nYou can find out more about Bill here:\nhttps://www.profbillallison.com/\n\nYou can check out Bill's podcast, \"Military Historians Are People, Too!\" here:\nhttps://www.mhptpodcast.com/\n\nWATCH MORE HOW REAL IS IT VIDEOS:\nAfghan War Veteran Rates 9 Afghanistan War Battles In Movies\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pvD0H9p7T0I\nMilitary Experts Rate 70 Military Battles In Movies And TV\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5hCKDPSSVi0\nWorld War I Expert Rates 6 WWI Battles in Movies\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cl3ySfKfv1s\n\n-----------------------------------------------------\n\n#Insider #HowRealIsIt #War \n\nInsider's mission is to inform and inspire. \n\nVisit our homepage for the top stories of the day: https://www.businessinsider.com/\nInsider on Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/insider\nInsider on Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/insider\nInsider on Twitter: https://twitter.com/thisisinsider\nInsider on Snapchat: https://www.snapchat.com/discover/Insider/2708030621\nInsider on TikTok: https://www.tiktok.com/@insider\n\nVietnam War Historian Breaks Down 8 Vietnam War Scenes In Movies And TV | How Real Is It? | Insider",

He looks at the realism of urban and jungle warfare, such as the battle of Hu\u1ebf during the Tet Offensive in \"Full Metal Jacket\" (1987) and \"Platoon\" (1986), featuring Willem Dafoe, Charlie Sheen, and Johnny Depp. Allison also looks at the portrayal of the Army of the Republic of Vietnam, or ARVN, in \"M\u00f9i C\u1ecf Ch\u00e1y\" (\"The Scent of Burning Grass\") (2012) and \"The Green Berets\" (1968), starring John Wayne. Additionally, he discusses the tragedies and aftermath of the Vietnam War, connecting the M\u1ef9 Lai massacre to the civilian deaths in \"Born on the Fourth of July\" (1989), with Tom Cruise, and talking about the Vietnam War POW/MIA issue in \"Rambo: First Blood Part II\" (1985), starring Sylvester Stallone.\n\nAllison is a professor of military history at Georgia Southern University. He has written several books about the Vietnam War, including \"My Lai: An American Atrocity in the Vietnam War.\" He is also a Vietnam battlefield tour guide with the UK company The Cultural Experience.\n\nYou can find out more about Bill here:\nhttps://www.profbillallison.com/\n\nYou can check out Bill's podcast, \"Military Historians Are People, Too!\" here:\nhttps://www.mhptpodcast.com/\n\nWATCH MORE HOW REAL IS IT VIDEOS:\nAfghan War Veteran Rates 9 Afghanistan War Battles In Movies\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pvD0H9p7T0I\nMilitary Experts Rate 70 Military Battles In Movies And TV\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5hCKDPSSVi0\nWorld War I Expert Rates 6 WWI Battles in Movies\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cl3ySfKfv1s\n\n-----------------------------------------------------\n\n#Insider #HowRealIsIt #War \n\nInsider's mission is to inform and inspire. \n\nVisit our homepage for the top stories of the day: https://www.businessinsider.com/\nInsider on Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/insider\nInsider on Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/insider\nInsider on Twitter: https://twitter.com/thisisinsider\nInsider on Snapchat: https://www.snapchat.com/discover/Insider/2708030621\nInsider on TikTok: https://www.tiktok.com/@insider\n\nVietnam War Historian Breaks Down 8 Vietnam War Scenes In Movies And TV | How Real Is It? | Insider"

He has written several books about the Vietnam War, including \"My Lai: An American Atrocity in the Vietnam War.\" He is also a Vietnam battlefield tour guide with the UK company The Cultural Experience.\n\nYou can find out more about Bill here:\nhttps://www.profbillallison.com/\nYou can check out Bill's podcast, \"Military Historians Are People, Too!\" here:\nhttps://www.mhptpodcast.com/\n\nWATCH MORE HOW REAL IS IT VIDEOS:\nAfghan War Veteran Rates 9 Afghanistan War Battles In Movies\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pvD0H9p7T0I\nMilitary Experts Rate 70 Military Battles In Movies And TV\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5hCKDPSSVi0\nWorld War I Expert Rates 6 WWI Battles in Movies\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cl3ySfKfv1s\n------------------------------------------------------\n\nInsider's mission is to inform and inspire. \n\nVisit our homepage for the top stories of the day: https://www.businessinsider.com/\nInsider on Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/insider\nInsider on Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/insider\nInsider on Twitter: https://twitter.com/thisisinsider\nInsider on Snapchat: https://www.snapchat.com/discover/Insider/2708030621\nInsider on TikTok: https://www.tiktok.com/@insider\n\nVietnam War Historian Breaks Down 7 More Vietnam War Scenes In Movies | How Real Is It? | Insider"

                    "description": "Cruise ship captain Wendy Williams rates eight cruise ship disasters in movies and television shows for realism.\n\nWilliams breaks down how cruise ships deal with hitting an iceberg, rogue waves, and tsunamis in \"The Poseidon Adventure\" (1972); the sinking scene in \"Titanic\" (1997), starring Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet; and the capsized vessel in \"Poseidon\" (2006). She explains how cruise ships address health issues and passenger safety on board in \"The Simpsons\" S23E19 (2012), the boat jail scene in \"It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia\" S11E9 and E10 (2016), and the cruise ship holiday nightmare in \"Triangle of Sadness\" (2022), with Woody Harrelson.

She explains how cruise ships address health issues and passenger safety on board in \"The Simpsons\" S23E19 (2012), the boat jail scene in \"It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia\" S11E9 and E10 (2016), and the cruise ship holiday nightmare in \"Triangle of Sadness\" (2022), with Woody Harrelson. Williams also looks at the plausibility of cruise ship systems being corrupted in \"Deep Rising\" (1998), and the shipwreck scene in \"Speed 2: Cruise Control\" (1997), with Willem Dafoe and Sandra Bullock.

He also comments on surprise attacks, cavalry, and helmets in \"War Horse\" (2011) and \"Blizzard of Souls\" (2019).

                    "description": "Marine biologist and doctoral student Amani Webber-Schultz rates 10 shark attacks in movies and TV shows, such as \"Jaws,\" for realism.\n\nWebber-Schultz breaks down the accuracy of shark behavior and appearances of the great white shark in \"Jaws\" (1975), \"The Requin\" (2022), and \"The Shallows\" (2016), starring Blake Lively. She looks at the likelihood of shark attacks in \"Unbroken\" (2014), \"47 Meters Down: Uncaged\" (2019), and \"Finding Nemo\" (2003).

                    "description": "Rebecca Simon, a piracy historian, rates pirate battles in movies and TV shows, such as the \"Pirates of the Caribbean\" movies, for realism.\n\nSimon breaks down the accuracy of pirate battle tactics used during the golden age of piracy, such as the use of the flintlock pistol and the rope-swinging skills to capture a ship in \"Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl\" (2003), with Johnny Depp, Orlando Bloom, and Keira Knightley; the realism of the Jolly Roger flag and the depiction of the real-life pirates Edward \"Blackbeard\" Teach, John \"Calico Jack\" Rackham, and Anne Bonny in \"Black Sails\" S1E1 and S3E10 (2014 and 2016); and the battle tactics used by pirate captains in \"House of the Dragon\" E2 and E3 (2022). She debunks common pirate tropes, such as buried treasure, treasure maps, and the stereotypical accent used by Long John Silver in \"Treasure Island\" (1950); the punishment of walking the plank in \"Peter Pan\" (1953); and swordsmanship and the use of the cutlass, as well as the relationship between the pirates Stede Bonnet and Blackbeard, in \"Our Flag Means Death\" S2E4 and S2E5 (2023), starring Taika Waititi. Simon also looks at the realism of Jack Sparrow and his compass in \"Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales\" (2017) and the plausibility of pirate bounties and privateers in \"One Piece\" S1E5 (2023).\n\nSimon is a historian who focuses on the golden age of piracy within the Caribbean and along the coast of North America. She has written several books on pirates, including her latest book, \"The Pirates' Code: Laws and Life Aboard Ship.\" She is also a professor of history at Santa Monica College.\n\nYou can follow Rebecca here:\nhttp://rebecca-simon.com/\n\n\"The Pirates' Code: Laws and Life Aboard Ship\":\nhttps://press.uchicago.edu/ucp/books/book/distributed/P/bo199165757.html\n\nMORE HOW REAL IS IT?

                        "description": "Rebecca Simon, a piracy historian, rates pirate battles in movies and TV shows, such as the \"Pirates of the Caribbean\" movies, for realism.\n\nSimon breaks down the accuracy of pirate battle tactics used during the golden age of piracy, such as the use of the flintlock pistol and the rope-swinging skills to capture a ship in \"Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl\" (2003), with Johnny Depp, Orlando Bloom, and Keira Knightley; the realism of the Jolly Roger flag and the depiction of the real-life pirates Edward \"Blackbeard\" Teach, John \"Calico Jack\" Rackham, and Anne Bonny in \"Black Sails\" S1E1 and S3E10 (2014 and 2016); and the battle tactics used by pirate captains in \"House of the Dragon\" E2 and E3 (2022). She debunks common pirate tropes, such as buried treasure, treasure maps, and the stereotypical accent used by Long John Silver in \"Treasure Island\" (1950); the punishment of walking the plank in \"Peter Pan\" (1953); and swordsmanship and the use of the cutlass, as well as the relationship between the pirates Stede Bonnet and Blackbeard, in \"Our Flag Means Death\" S2E4 and S2E5 (2023), starring Taika Waititi. Simon also looks at the realism of Jack Sparrow and his compass in \"Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales\" (2017) and the plausibility of pirate bounties and privateers in \"One Piece\" S1E5 (2023).\n\nSimon is a historian who focuses on the golden age of piracy within the Caribbean and along the coast of North America. She has written several books on pirates, including her latest book, \"The Pirates' Code: Laws and Life Aboard Ship.\" She is also a professor of history at Santa Monica College.\n\nYou can follow Rebecca here:\nhttp://rebecca-simon.com/\n\n\"The Pirates' Code: Laws and Life Aboard Ship\":\nhttps://press.uchicago.edu/ucp/books/book/distributed/P/bo199165757.html\n\nMORE HOW REAL IS IT?

                    "description": "Terry Adams Jr., a former US Army working dog handler, rates eight military dogs in movies and television shows for realism.\n\nAdams breaks down various breeds of military working dogs, particularly the Belgian Malinois, in the search-and-apprehension scenes in \"SEAL Team\" S1E7 and E14, the explosive-detection dog in \"Megan Leavey,\" and the guard dogs in \"John Wick: Chapter 3 \u2014 Parabellum,\" with Keanu Reeves and Halle Berry. He looks at working dogs outside of the military, such as the narcotics-detection dog in \"Breaking Bad\" S4E12, starring Bryan Cranston and Aaron Paul; and the German shepherd in \"I Am Legend,\" who protects her owner \u2014 played by Will Smith \u2014 at all costs. He also explains the safety protocols and realities of dog handling during warfare, such as detecting weapons and explosives in \"Max,\" and \"NCIS\" S10E18, and the realities of post-traumatic stress disorder among retired military working dogs in \"Dog,\" starring Channing Tatum.\n\nAdams has six years of experience as a military working dog handler for the US Army, as well as 10 years of experience handling and training civilian dogs.

                        "description": "Terry Adams Jr., a former US Army working dog handler, rates eight military dogs in movies and television shows for realism.\n\nAdams breaks down various breeds of military working dogs, particularly the Belgian Malinois, in the search-and-apprehension scenes in \"SEAL Team\" S1E7 and E14, the explosive-detection dog in \"Megan Leavey,\" and the guard dogs in \"John Wick: Chapter 3 \u2014 Parabellum,\" with Keanu Reeves and Halle Berry. He looks at working dogs outside of the military, such as the narcotics-detection dog in \"Breaking Bad\" S4E12, starring Bryan Cranston and Aaron Paul; and the German shepherd in \"I Am Legend,\" who protects her owner \u2014 played by Will Smith \u2014 at all costs. He also explains the safety protocols and realities of dog handling during warfare, such as detecting weapons and explosives in \"Max,\" and \"NCIS\" S10E18, and the realities of post-traumatic stress disorder among retired military working dogs in \"Dog,\" starring Channing Tatum.\n\nAdams has six years of experience as a military working dog handler for the US Army, as well as 10 years of experience handling and training civilian dogs. He had three military combat deployments, all in Afghanistan. He is the founder and head trainer of Tactical K9, a facility for training civilian and military dogs.\n\nFollow Terry Adams Jr. here:\nhttps://tacticalk9.co/\nhttps://www.instagram.com/tacticalk9approach/\n\nMORE HOW REAL IS IT?

She looks at the realism of monkey and ape attacks against humans and other animals, such the plausibility of a reptile-like Godzilla fighting an ape-like Kong in \"Godzilla x Kong: The New Empire\"; the fight between a gorilla and leopard in \"Tarzan\" (1999); and the mandrills attacking humans in \"Jumanji: The Next Level,\" starring Dwayne Johnson, Kevin Hart, and Awkwafina. Mayor also breaks down the evolution of ape and monkeys, such as the common ancestor of humans and apes, the hominin, in \"2001: A Space Odyssey\"; the Gigantopithecus in \"The Jungle Book\" (2016); and the capuchin monkey in  \"Night at the Museum,\" with Ben Stiller.\n\nMayor is a primatologist and explorer who has gone on expeditions to study apes and monkeys such as mountain gorillas, western lowland gorillas, and the white-faced saki monkey. She is a wildlife correspondent for National Geographic, where she was also part of a research expedition that discovered a new species of lemur, considered to be the world's smallest primate. She wrote the book \"Pink Boots and a Machete: My Journey From NFL Cheerleader to National Geographic Explorer,\" with a foreword by Jane Goodall.

                    "description": "Jimmy Tsui is a former member of Tung On in New York City's Chinatown and of the Sun Yee On triad in Hong Kong.\n\nIn 1985 in New York, he was arrested and charged with robbery and homicide, with a $1.5 million-dollar bail. The case was later dismissed. This led to his transition into Sun Yee On, where he became a \"426 general\" in 1988.\n\nHe traveled back and forth between Hong Kong and New York City and was involved in karaoke bars, gambling houses, and various scams. In 1992, he was shot five times while sitting in his car. This ended his involvement in mob life. Around this time, the influence of the Chinese mafia in New York was declining, and Tsui's network dissolved.\nTsui speaks with Insider about how the triads make money, such as extortion and protection rackets. He discusses the initiation ceremonies and rules of membership as well as the ties to the movie business. He also covers the triads' global expansion.\n\nAfter leaving the triads, Tsui got involved with Chinatown Gang Stories, a YouTube channel organized by Mike Moy, a former gang member, and New York City Police Department officer. \n\nChapter 1: Joining the Triads - 00:34\nChapter 2: The Money - 03:16\nChapter 3: The Secret Codes - 06:16\nChapter 4: The Hierarchy - 07:52\nChapter 5: The Rivalries - 10:35\nChapter 6: The Parking Lot Shooting - 13:24\nChapter 7: The Origin - 16:12\nChapter 8: The Backstory - 17:15\nChapter 9: The Future - 19:02\n\nFind more of Tsui's interviews here:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/@chinatowngangstories\nhttps://www.instagram.com/chinatowngangstories/\n\nMORE HOW CRIME WORKS VIDEOS:\nHow New York Chinatown Gangs Actually Work | How Crime Works | Insider\nhttps://youtu.be/2osXEixd3kM\nHow The Yakuza Actually Works | How Crime Works | Insider\nhttps://youtu.be/KDHhSqydJJo\nHow Serial-Killer Investigations Actually Work | How Crime Works | Insider\nhttps://youtu.be/GHLYtKi0xJI\n\n------------------------------------------------------\n\n#HongKong #HowCrimeWorks #Insider\n\nInsider is great journalism about what passionate people actually want to know.

                        "description": "Jimmy Tsui is a former member of Tung On in New York City's Chinatown and of the Sun Yee On triad in Hong Kong.\n\nIn 1985 in New York, he was arrested and charged with robbery and homicide, with a $1.5 million-dollar bail. The case was later dismissed. This led to his transition into Sun Yee On, where he became a \"426 general\" in 1988.\n\nHe traveled back and forth between Hong Kong and New York City and was involved in karaoke bars, gambling houses, and various scams. In 1992, he was shot five times while sitting in his car. This ended his involvement in mob life. Around this time, the influence of the Chinese mafia in New York was declining, and Tsui's network dissolved.\nTsui speaks with Insider about how the triads make money, such as extortion and protection rackets. He discusses the initiation ceremonies and rules of membership as well as the ties to the movie business. He also covers the triads' global expansion.\n\nAfter leaving the triads, Tsui got involved with Chinatown Gang Stories, a YouTube channel organized by Mike Moy, a former gang member, and New York City Police Department officer. \n\nChapter 1: Joining the Triads - 00:34\nChapter 2: The Money - 03:16\nChapter 3: The Secret Codes - 06:16\nChapter 4: The Hierarchy - 07:52\nChapter 5: The Rivalries - 10:35\nChapter 6: The Parking Lot Shooting - 13:24\nChapter 7: The Origin - 16:12\nChapter 8: The Backstory - 17:15\nChapter 9: The Future - 19:02\n\nFind more of Tsui's interviews here:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/@chinatowngangstories\nhttps://www.instagram.com/chinatowngangstories/\n\nMORE HOW CRIME WORKS VIDEOS:\nHow New York Chinatown Gangs Actually Work | How Crime Works | Insider\nhttps://youtu.be/2osXEixd3kM\nHow The Yakuza Actually Works | How Crime Works | Insider\nhttps://youtu.be/KDHhSqydJJo\nHow Serial-Killer Investigations Actually Work | How Crime Works | Insider\nhttps://youtu.be/GHLYtKi0xJI\n\n------------------------------------------------------\n\n#HongKong #HowCrimeWorks #Insider\n\nInsider is great journalism about what passionate people actually want to know.

                        "description": "John \"Boxer\" Mendoza is a former high-ranking member of the Nuestra Familia. He was part of the organization from 1994 to 2007 and was incarcerated at various California prisons, such as San Quentin, Pelican Bay, and Corcoran.\n\nHe was a member of the Nuestra Raza before rising to the rank of commander in the Nuestra Familia. Mendoza speaks with Insider about rivalry with the Mexican Mafia and Aryan Brotherhood, corrupt prison guards, attacks and uprisings, weapons, and yard fights. He also talks about life inside the gang, from rules to prison tattoos and methods of communication in jail.\n\nNowadays he has a YouTube channel called Paradigm Media News, where he does interviews with other former gang members and talks about life since leaving prison.

                    "description": "Jeff Turner counterfeited over $1 million in US currency. He forged the 1996-series $100 bill and later the 2013 \"blue note.\" He was indicted on federal conspiracy charges in 2019 and cooperated with the Secret Service, eventually serving 10 months in prison. According to Turner, the Secret Service said the bills he was manufacturing were the highest quality they'd seen in over 25 years. \n\nTurner speaks to Insider about the materials and processes required to make fake money.

He forged the 1996-series $100 bill and later the 2013 \"blue note.\" He was indicted on federal conspiracy charges in 2019 and cooperated with the Secret Service, eventually serving 10 months in prison. According to Turner, the Secret Service said the bills he was manufacturing were the highest quality they'd seen in over 25 years. \n\nTurner speaks to Insider about the materials and processes required to make fake money. He talks through how to spot a fake bank note. He also discusses cartel forgeries from Colombia and Peru, and the \"supernotes\" the US has accused North Korea of making.

                    "description": "Alex Sanchez is a former high-ranking member of MS-13. He became involved in the gang in the 1980s in Los Angeles and participated in its expansion.\n\nSanchez was deported to El Salvador in 1994 along with 4,000 other Salvadorans. There, he began to recruit young members into the gang. He was involved in robberies, street fights, and carjackings, and he survived being shot four times. Sanchez decided to leave MS-13 in the mid-1990s. He is now the executive director of Homies Unidos and is a violence-prevention worker and expert on gang culture.\n\nHe speaks with Business Insider about the Los Angeles Police Department, tattooing, rules and codes, media perception, and the political language used to depict the gang, such as Donald Trump's comments in 2018. Sanchez's story is profiled in the books \"MS-13: The Making of America's Most Notorious Gang\" and \"Unforgetting: A Memoir of Family, Migration, Gangs, and Revolution in the Americas.\"\n\nFind out more:\nwww.homiesunidos.org\nhttps://www.facebook.com/homiesunidosla\n\nMORE HOW CRIME WORKS VIDEOS:\nHow The Crips Gang Actually Works | How Crime Works | Insider\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VylZeRkWzbY\nHow Cocaine Trafficking Actually Works | Posh Pete\u2019s Full Story | How Crime Works Uncut\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qwRl-2_pHSA\nHow The Latin Kings Gang Actually Works | How Crime Works | Insider\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBVoamH5qVM\n\n------------------------------------------------------\n\n00:00 - Intro\n00:23 - The Initiation\n01:48 - The Weapons\n03:19 - The Tattoos\n04:19 - The Rivals\n05:58 - The Rules\n07:25 - The Culture\n08:46 - Return to El Salvador\n10:20 - Death Threats\n12:55 - The Hierarchy\n13:54 - Megajails\n16:17 - The Expansion\n17:33 - LAPD\n20:18 - The Future of MS-13\n21:54 - The Aftermath\n24:19 - Credits\n\nInsider's mission is to inform and inspire. \n\nVisit our homepage for the top stories of the day: https://www.businessinsider.com/\nInsider on Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/insider\nInsider on Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/insider\nInsider on Twitter: https://twitter.com/thisisinsider\nInsider on Snapchat: https://www.snapchat.com/discover/Insider/2708030621\nInsider on TikTok: https://www.tiktok.com/@insider\n\nHow The MS-13 Gang Actually Works | How Crime Works | Insider",

He became involved in the gang in the 1980s in Los Angeles and participated in its expansion.\n\nSanchez was deported to El Salvador in 1994 along with 4,000 other Salvadorans. There, he began to recruit young members into the gang. He was involved in robberies, street fights, and carjackings, and he survived being shot four times. Sanchez decided to leave MS-13 in the mid-1990s. He is now the executive director of Homies Unidos and is a violence-prevention worker and expert on gang culture.\n\nHe speaks with Business Insider about the Los Angeles Police Department, tattooing, rules and codes, media perception, and the political language used to depict the gang, such as Donald Trump's comments in 2018. Sanchez's story is profiled in the books \"MS-13: The Making of America's Most Notorious Gang\" and \"Unforgetting: A Memoir of Family, Migration, Gangs, and Revolution in the Americas.\"\n\nFind out more:\nwww.homiesunidos.org\nhttps://www.facebook.com/homiesunidosla\n\nMORE HOW CRIME WORKS VIDEOS:\nHow The Crips Gang Actually Works | How Crime Works | Insider\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VylZeRkWzbY\nHow Cocaine Trafficking Actually Works | Posh Pete\u2019s Full Story | How Crime Works Uncut\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qwRl-2_pHSA\nHow The Latin Kings Gang Actually Works | How Crime Works | Insider\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBVoamH5qVM\n\n------------------------------------------------------\n\n00:00 - Intro\n00:23 - The Initiation\n01:48 - The Weapons\n03:19 - The Tattoos\n04:19 - The Rivals\n05:58 - The Rules\n07:25 - The Culture\n08:46 - Return to El Salvador\n10:20 - Death Threats\n12:55 - The Hierarchy\n13:54 - Megajails\n16:17 - The Expansion\n17:33 - LAPD\n20:18 - The Future of MS-13\n21:54 - The Aftermath\n24:19 - Credits\n\nInsider's mission is to inform and inspire. \n\nVisit our homepage for the top stories of the day: https://www.businessinsider.com/\nInsider on Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/insider\nInsider on Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/insider\nInsider on Twitter: https://twitter.com/thisisinsider\nInsider on Snapchat: https://www.snapchat.com/discover/Insider/2708030621\nInsider on TikTok: https://www.tiktok.com/@insider\n\nHow The MS-13 Gang Actually Works | How Crime Works | Insider"
