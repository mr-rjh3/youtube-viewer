After our 3 way collab with @TheRybkaTwins and the @merrelltwins  , we decided this would be such a fun idea to try out with our husbands! The trick today is to see if our husbands have telepathy with us and can guess what we ordered a the drive through. You'll have to watch and see which couple does better!  \n\nThis drive through challenge is a great way to test your telepathic abilities and see who can communicate the best with their partner. Whether you're a couple or a single person, this is a fun and exciting challenge you don't want to miss! \n\nComment down below which couple you think had the best telepathy!\n- Bailey\n\nYou can check out our shop HERE: www.lashnextdoor.com\n\nDon't forget to follow us on other platforms where we post daily!\n   Instagram | http://instagram.com/brooklynandbailey\n   Tik Tok | @BrooklynAndBailey\n   Twitter | http://twitter.com/brookandbailey\n   Facebook | http://facebook.com/brooklynandbailey\n   SnapChat | http://snapchat.com/add/BrookAndBailey\n   Spotify | https://open.spotify.com/artist/4Y8tcJEqYuIDSNAZEqu9Nd\n   SoundCloud | http://soundcloud.com/brooklynandbailey\n\nFTC Disclaimer: This is not a sponsored video.\n\n\n\ud83d\udca5HELP US OUT\ud83d\udca5: You can help us translate our uploads, and get credit below each video!

After our 3 way collab with @TheRybkaTwins and the @merrelltwins  , we decided this would be such a fun idea to try out with our husbands! The trick today is to see if our husbands have telepathy with us and can guess what we ordered a the drive through. You'll have to watch and see which couple does better!  \n\nThis drive through challenge is a great way to test your telepathic abilities and see who can communicate the best with their partner. Whether you're a couple or a single person, this is a fun and exciting challenge you don't want to miss! \n\nComment down below which couple you think had the best telepathy!\n- Bailey\n\nYou can check out our shop HERE: www.lashnextdoor.com\n\nDon't forget to follow us on other platforms where we post daily!\n   Instagram | http://instagram.com/brooklynandbailey\n   Tik Tok | @BrooklynAndBailey\n   Twitter | http://twitter.com/brookandbailey\n   Facebook | http://facebook.com/brooklynandbailey\n   SnapChat | http://snapchat.com/add/BrookAndBailey\n   Spotify | https://open.spotify.com/artist/4Y8tcJEqYuIDSNAZEqu9Nd\n   SoundCloud | http://soundcloud.com/brooklynandbailey\n\nFTC Disclaimer: This is not a sponsored video.\n\n\n\ud83d\udca5HELP US OUT\ud83d\udca5: You can help us translate our uploads, and get credit below each video!

                    "description": "We\u2019ve seen a few people on TikTok sending quizzes to people they\u2019ve had crushes on in the past, and we think that this trend is so hilarious and fun! Our friend, Jazzy Anne, also posted a similar video and we were so highly entertained while watching hers, we knew we wanted to make our own version! We loved the questions that she put on her quiz, so we reached out to her to ask if we could use some of them! Shoutout to her for allowing us to use some of her golden questions! \n\nBasically, the idea is to create a quiz with different questions for guys/girls that you\u2019ve dated to answer! For example: on a scale of 1-10, \u201crate my attractiveness\u201d or \u201crate my personality\u201d , and YES it\u2019s cringey but it\u2019s so funny to see how the guys respond! \n\nBailey has only dated one person in her whole life, so it was obvious from the start that I would be taking on this challenge alone! \ud83d\ude02 Although it was a little awkward for me, it was also so entertaining, and I found out a lot about how the guys I have been on dates with really feel about me! \n\nWould you ever send a quiz like this to people you\u2019ve dated in the past??

                        "description": "We\u2019ve seen a few people on TikTok sending quizzes to people they\u2019ve had crushes on in the past, and we think that this trend is so hilarious and fun! Our friend, Jazzy Anne, also posted a similar video and we were so highly entertained while watching hers, we knew we wanted to make our own version! We loved the questions that she put on her quiz, so we reached out to her to ask if we could use some of them! Shoutout to her for allowing us to use some of her golden questions! \n\nBasically, the idea is to create a quiz with different questions for guys/girls that you\u2019ve dated to answer! For example: on a scale of 1-10, \u201crate my attractiveness\u201d or \u201crate my personality\u201d , and YES it\u2019s cringey but it\u2019s so funny to see how the guys respond! \n\nBailey has only dated one person in her whole life, so it was obvious from the start that I would be taking on this challenge alone! \ud83d\ude02 Although it was a little awkward for me, it was also so entertaining, and I found out a lot about how the guys I have been on dates with really feel about me! \n\nWould you ever send a quiz like this to people you\u2019ve dated in the past?? Comment below! \n\n\nThis video was just as fun to film as our recent Twin Swap videos.

Luckily Asa and the family vlogged the entire thing so we can show you all the planning prep that went into it. Special thanks to JamesAllen.com for providing the ring and sponsoring this video! What was your favorite part of this video? COMMENT BELOW!\n\n\u2705 To check out JamesAllen.com, click HERE \ud83d\udc49\ud83c\udffb : https://bit.ly/3x9CgOJ\n\nIn the lead up to our actual #weddingproposal, Asa planned everything out to a \"T\", he diary vlogged the whole process... including how he picked out, customized, ordered and received the #engagement ring (SO BEAUTIFUL). Asa also filmed the process of asking my parents' and Brooklyn\u2019s permission (he was so nervous lol), and also shares how he coordinated with our families and friends for when and how to propose to me, what cover story he told me to throw me off, and the day of prep work with our large extended families to make it all happen! \n\n\u2705 Be sure to follow us on Instagram to see MORE PROPOSAL PHOTOS and Stories! \ud83d\udc49\ud83c\udffb https://www.instagram.com/BrooklynAndBailey\n\nSome of y\u2019all thought I had been part of planning everything, or knew what was going on, but I LITERALLY HAD NO CLUE it was going to happen that weekend! Brooklyn knows me so well, and took charge! Asa and my family put a ton of effort into making sure I was surprised, including uploading fake IGS stories from other locations that weekend to throw me off, and it definitely worked. \n\nWhat was really cool was having Brooklyn, the best twin ever and my lifelong partner in crime, helping take video and pictures, and making sure that I was at my best for such an important day! It meant the world to me that she was there! I LOVE HER!\n\nSpecial thanks to everyone in our families and friend groups who helped along the way, and to all of you for being SO EXCITED for us! Stay tuned at the end to watch me BAWL my eyes out while watching our engagement video for the first time... it had over 5.6M views in the first week, and at least 5.5M of those were probably me!\n\nWhat was your favorite part of this video?

                        "description": "So many of y\u2019all asked for the BTS \"Behind the Scenes\" of what went down leading up to the proposal! Luckily Asa and the family vlogged the entire thing so we can show you all the planning prep that went into it. Special thanks to JamesAllen.com for providing the ring and sponsoring this video! What was your favorite part of this video? COMMENT BELOW!\n\n\u2705 To check out JamesAllen.com, click HERE \ud83d\udc49\ud83c\udffb : https://bit.ly/3x9CgOJ\n\nIn the lead up to our actual #weddingproposal, Asa planned everything out to a \"T\", he diary vlogged the whole process... including how he picked out, customized, ordered and received the #engagement ring (SO BEAUTIFUL). Asa also filmed the process of asking my parents' and Brooklyn\u2019s permission (he was so nervous lol), and also shares how he coordinated with our families and friends for when and how to propose to me, what cover story he told me to throw me off, and the day of prep work with our large extended families to make it all happen! \n\n\u2705 Be sure to follow us on Instagram to see MORE PROPOSAL PHOTOS and Stories! \ud83d\udc49\ud83c\udffb https://www.instagram.com/BrooklynAndBailey\n\nSome of y\u2019all thought I had been part of planning everything, or knew what was going on, but I LITERALLY HAD NO CLUE it was going to happen that weekend! Brooklyn knows me so well, and took charge! Asa and my family put a ton of effort into making sure I was surprised, including uploading fake IGS stories from other locations that weekend to throw me off, and it definitely worked. \n\nWhat was really cool was having Brooklyn, the best twin ever and my lifelong partner in crime, helping take video and pictures, and making sure that I was at my best for such an important day! It meant the world to me that she was there! I LOVE HER!\n\nSpecial thanks to everyone in our families and friend groups who helped along the way, and to all of you for being SO EXCITED for us! Stay tuned at the end to watch me BAWL my eyes out while watching our engagement video for the first time... it had over 5.6M views in the first week, and at least 5.5M of those were probably me!\n\nWhat was your favorite part of this video?

She discusses the positives of her upbringing, like her community of siblings, as well as the harmful dynamics she witnessed often at the expense of women. Jinger recalls the origins of her disordered eating and how her mom helped her through it, what forced her to finally challenge her beliefs, and her technical approach to disentangling her truth from the religious falsehoods she was taught to believe. Mayim breaks down religious obsessive compulsive disorder and shares her pop culture recommendations with Jinger. They discuss why Jinger still wants to be in the public eye, how she feels about her parents now, and the value of privacy after a life of being observed.

He discusses the changes he\u2019s seen in relationships over the decades, the spiritual integrity component of successful relationships, and how the mindsets of ego can negatively impact any relationship. Dr. Richo demonstrates practical language used to strengthen a relationship after conflict and shares ways to identify candidates who are qualified to be in a healthy adult relationship. He reveals how his findings hold up when considering polyamorous connections, how fear manifests itself in relationships, why expressing appreciation should never be underestimated, and why we are more likely to be emotionally satisfied during the \\\"honeymoon stage.\\\" Dr. Rich also explains how to mirror healthy love for your children, the actual forms of nurturing kids crave from their parents, and practical ways to teach children independence.\n\n---\n\nListen on our website: https://www.bialikbreakdown.com\u200b\u200b\nListen on Spotify: https://open.spotify.com/show/6TgOe2poCdpZtQwKetQmU1\nListen on Apple Podcasts: https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/mayim-bialiks-breakdown/id1546456269\nCheck out our Merch: https://shop.bialikbreakdown.com/\nSign up for our Newsletter: https://www.bialikbreakdown.com\u200b\u200b\nFollow us on Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/bialikbreakdown/\n\nFind Mayim Bialik:\nhttps://www.facebook.com/MissMayim/\u200b\u200b\u200b\nhttps://www.twitter.com/MissMayim/\u200b\u200b\u200b\nhttps://www.instagram.com/MissMayim/\u200b\u200b\u200b\nhttps://www.tiktok.com/@mayimbialik\n\nFind Dr. David Richo:\nTwitter: https://www.twitter.com/ShambhalaPubs\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/shambhala_publications\n\nDr. David Richo\u2019s book, How to Be an Adult in Relationships: https://www.shambhala.com/how-to-be-an-adult-in-relationships-9781611809541.html\n\nDr. David Richo's book, How to Be an Adult in Love: https://www.shambhala.com/how-to-be-an-adult-in-love-2943.html\n\nGet 25% off his online course, \"How to Be an Adult in Relationships\", with code \"MB25\": https://how-to-be-an-adult-in-relationships.webflow.io/\n\nTheme Song Written, Produced, and Performed by Ed Robertson.

He reveals how his findings hold up when considering polyamorous connections, how fear manifests itself in relationships, why expressing appreciation should never be underestimated, and why we are more likely to be emotionally satisfied during the \\\"honeymoon stage.\\\" Dr. Rich also explains how to mirror healthy love for your children, the actual forms of nurturing kids crave from their parents, and practical ways to teach children independence.\n\n---\n\nListen on our website: https://www.bialikbreakdown.com\u200b\u200b\nListen on Spotify: https://open.spotify.com/show/6TgOe2poCdpZtQwKetQmU1\nListen on Apple Podcasts: https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/mayim-bialiks-breakdown/id1546456269\nCheck out our Merch: https://shop.bialikbreakdown.com/\nSign up for our Newsletter: https://www.bialikbreakdown.com\u200b\u200b\nFollow us on Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/bialikbreakdown/\n\nFind Mayim Bialik:\nhttps://www.facebook.com/MissMayim/\u200b\u200b\u200b\nhttps://www.twitter.com/MissMayim/\u200b\u200b\u200b\nhttps://www.instagram.com/MissMayim/\u200b\u200b\u200b\nhttps://www.tiktok.com/@mayimbialik\n\nFind Dr. David Richo:\nTwitter: https://www.twitter.com/ShambhalaPubs\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/shambhala_publications\n\nDr. David Richo\u2019s book, How to Be an Adult in Relationships: https://www.shambhala.com/how-to-be-an-adult-in-relationships-9781611809541.html\n\nDr. David Richo's book, How to Be an Adult in Love: https://www.shambhala.com/how-to-be-an-adult-in-love-2943.html\n\nGet 25% off his online course, \"How to Be an Adult in Relationships\", with code \"MB25\": https://how-to-be-an-adult-in-relationships.webflow.io/\n\nTheme Song Written, Produced, and Performed by Ed Robertson.

He and Mayim discuss the power of music, the science of acting, and the psychological awareness that comes with Dustin\u2019s performances. Dustin explains why he is so observant and in touch with his emotions and his thoughts about death and spirituality, and Mayim breaks down hypervigilance. Dustin reveals what it was like to be directed by Mayim in her new film, As They Made Us. \n\n---\n\nTrailer for As They Made Us: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oU-b6NoDkiU\n\nAsk Mayim Anything: https://www.bialikbreakdown.com\u200b\u200b\nListen on Spotify: https://open.spotify.com/show/6TgOe2poCdpZtQwKetQmU1\nListen on Apple Podcasts: https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/mayim-bialiks-breakdown/id1546456269\nSign up for Mayim Bialik's Breakdown Newsletter: https://www.bialikbreakdown.com\u200b\u200b\n\nFind Mayim Bialik:\nhttps://www.facebook.com/MissMayim/\u200b\u200b\u200b\nhttps://www.twitter.com/MissMayim/\u200b\u200b\u200b\nhttps://www.instagram.com/MissMayim/\u200b\u200b\u200b\n\nTheme Song Written, Produced and Performed by Ed Robertson.

He and Mayim discuss the power of music, the science of acting, and the psychological awareness that comes with Dustin\u2019s performances. Dustin explains why he is so observant and in touch with his emotions and his thoughts about death and spirituality, and Mayim breaks down hypervigilance. Dustin reveals what it was like to be directed by Mayim in her new film, As They Made Us. \n\n---\n\nTrailer for As They Made Us: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oU-b6NoDkiU\n\nAsk Mayim Anything: https://www.bialikbreakdown.com\u200b\u200b\nListen on Spotify: https://open.spotify.com/show/6TgOe2poCdpZtQwKetQmU1\nListen on Apple Podcasts: https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/mayim-bialiks-breakdown/id1546456269\nSign up for Mayim Bialik's Breakdown Newsletter: https://www.bialikbreakdown.com\u200b\u200b\n\nFind Mayim Bialik:\nhttps://www.facebook.com/MissMayim/\u200b\u200b\u200b\nhttps://www.twitter.com/MissMayim/\u200b\u200b\u200b\nhttps://www.instagram.com/MissMayim/\u200b\u200b\u200b\n\nTheme Song Written, Produced and Performed by Ed Robertson.

The format is a bit different from our usual episodes, but we think you'll enjoy them nonetheless. Mandy Teefey (Co-founder and Co-CEO of Wondermind, Producer of 13 Reasons Why, Selena Gomez\u2019s mom) stops by to discuss the origin of her mental health platform, Wondermind, and its mission to destigmatize and democratize mental health. She opens up about being misdiagnosed with bipolar disorder and her tips for breaking up hyperfocus for those like herself living with ADHD and trauma. Mandy explains the importance of maintaining mental fitness and the benefits of being out in nature. We then pivot to an extended breakdown featuring just Mayim and Jonathan where they break down their \u201covert\u201d and \u201ccovert\u201d mental health hacks, from practicing good sleep hygiene and being in touch with sensory sensitivities, to hitting the social reset button and re-examining our relationships with social media.\n---\nListen on our website: https://www.bialikbreakdown.com\u200b\u200b\nListen on Spotify: https://open.spotify.com/show/6TgOe2poCdpZtQwKetQmU1\nListen on Apple Podcasts: https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/mayim-bialiks-breakdown/id1546456269\nSign up for Mayim Bialik's Breakdown Newsletter: https://www.bialikbreakdown.com\u200b\u200b\nFollow us on Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/bialikbreakdown/\n\nFind Mandy Teefey:\nInstagram: @mandyteefey\nLink to Wondermind: https://www.wondermind.com/\n\nFind Mayim Bialik:\nhttps://www.facebook.com/MissMayim/\u200b\u200b\u200b\nhttps://www.twitter.com/MissMayim/\u200b\u200b\u200b\nhttps://www.instagram.com/MissMayim/\u200b\u200b\u200b\nhttps://www.tiktok.com/@mayimbialik\n\nTheme Song Written, Produced, and Performed by Ed Robertson.

                        "description": "Join us for our first special Summer Edition of Mayim Bialik\u2019s Breakdown! The format is a bit different from our usual episodes, but we think you'll enjoy them nonetheless. Mandy Teefey (Co-founder and Co-CEO of Wondermind, Producer of 13 Reasons Why, Selena Gomez\u2019s mom) stops by to discuss the origin of her mental health platform, Wondermind, and its mission to destigmatize and democratize mental health. She opens up about being misdiagnosed with bipolar disorder and her tips for breaking up hyperfocus for those like herself living with ADHD and trauma. Mandy explains the importance of maintaining mental fitness and the benefits of being out in nature. We then pivot to an extended breakdown featuring just Mayim and Jonathan where they break down their \u201covert\u201d and \u201ccovert\u201d mental health hacks, from practicing good sleep hygiene and being in touch with sensory sensitivities, to hitting the social reset button and re-examining our relationships with social media.\n---\nListen on our website: https://www.bialikbreakdown.com\u200b\u200b\nListen on Spotify: https://open.spotify.com/show/6TgOe2poCdpZtQwKetQmU1\nListen on Apple Podcasts: https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/mayim-bialiks-breakdown/id1546456269\nSign up for Mayim Bialik's Breakdown Newsletter: https://www.bialikbreakdown.com\u200b\u200b\nFollow us on Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/bialikbreakdown/\n\nFind Mandy Teefey:\nInstagram: @mandyteefey\nLink to Wondermind: https://www.wondermind.com/\n\nFind Mayim Bialik:\nhttps://www.facebook.com/MissMayim/\u200b\u200b\u200b\nhttps://www.twitter.com/MissMayim/\u200b\u200b\u200b\nhttps://www.instagram.com/MissMayim/\u200b\u200b\u200b\nhttps://www.tiktok.com/@mayimbialik\n\nTheme Song Written, Produced, and Performed by Ed Robertson.

                    "description": "Bev breaks down previous episodes in our seventh Bevisode installment! This week, Bev opens up about the perks of being Mayim\u2019s mom, why she doesn\u2019t take the praise for who Mayim is today, and her Moment of Peace and Calm.

She explains how therapy and sobriety allow her to be a better parent and the importance of honesty in a parent-child relationship.

He details his class clown and theatre beginnings, finding his comedy partner in Kenan Thompson, and the impact of the diversity shown on All That. Kel draws comparisons between his childhood in the southside of Chicago where he lost loved ones to gun and gang violence and the trauma young celebrities face in Hollywood. He discusses getting married at an early age and dealing with anxiety stemming from confusion over whether people loved him for his comedy characters or his true self. Kel opens up about his suicide attempt, how his faith led him to pursue a path toward mental wellness, and his journey to becoming a youth pastor. Mayim and Kel consider the mental health impact of living in communities touched by violence and intergenerational trauma. \n\n\n--\n\nAsk Mayim Anything: https://www.bialikbreakdown.com/\nListen on Spotify: https://open.spotify.com/show/6TgOe2poCdpZtQwKetQmU1\nListen on Apple Podcasts: https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/mayim-bialiks-breakdown/id1546456269\nSign up for Mayim Bialik's Breakdown Newsletter: https://www.bialikbreakdown.com\u200b\u200b\n\nFind Mayim Bialik:\nhttps://www.facebook.com/MissMayim/\u200b\u200b\u200b\nhttps://www.twitter.com/MissMayim/\u200b\u200b\u200b\nhttps://www.instagram.com/MissMayim/\u200b\u200b\u200b\n\n\nFind Kel Mitchell:\nhttps://facebook.com/iamkelmitchell\nhttps://www.instagram.com/iamkelmitchell/\nhttps://twitter.com/iamkelmitchell\nKel Mitchell's Book: https://www.amazon.com/Blessed-Mode-Days-Level-Faith/dp/1400229189\n\n\nTheme Song Written, Produced, and Performed by Ed Robertson.

She discusses how she managed to stay grounded while growing up in the public eye, overcoming her insecurities, and the spiritual lessons she has learned from studying the patterns in her life. Danica explains why she took a break from acting to study math, the empowerment it offered her, and her passion for making math accessible to everyone. Mayim breaks down the clinical definition of hoarding and the science behind giving birth and motherhood. She considers the causes of child development delays in another installment of Ask Mayim Anything.

                        "description": "Danica McKellar (The Wonder Years actress, author, producer, speaker, and mathematician) joins us to discuss what it was like to play the character of \u201cWinnie Cooper\u201d in The Wonder Years, and her struggle to find her identity separate from the iconic dreamgirl role. She discusses how she managed to stay grounded while growing up in the public eye, overcoming her insecurities, and the spiritual lessons she has learned from studying the patterns in her life. Danica explains why she took a break from acting to study math, the empowerment it offered her, and her passion for making math accessible to everyone. Mayim breaks down the clinical definition of hoarding and the science behind giving birth and motherhood. She considers the causes of child development delays in another installment of Ask Mayim Anything.

Mayim and Moshe explore the idea of the chicken and the egg when it came to his therapy early in life; whether he was exposed to therapy because of exhibited behaviors or whether that exposure fed into those behaviors. We close the episode by coming full circle with a callback to Rick Doblin\u2019s MAPS and the idea that the only way to truly heal from trauma is to go back through it.\n\n\n---\n\nAsk Mayim Anything: https://www.bialikbreakdown.com/#ask-mayim\n\nListen on Spotify: https://open.spotify.com/show/6TgOe2poCdpZtQwKetQmU1\nListen on Apple Podcasts: https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/mayim-bialiks-breakdown/id1546456269\nSign up for Mayim Bialik's Breakdown Newsletter: https://www.bialikbreakdown.com\u200b\u200b\n\nFind Mayim Bialik:\nhttps://www.facebook.com/MissMayim/\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\nhttps://www.twitter.com/MissMayim/\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\nhttps://www.instagram.com/MissMayim/\u200b\u200b\u200b\n\nFind Moshe Kasher:\nhttps://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=100045377343520\nhttps://twitter.com/moshekasher\nhttps://www.instagram.com/moshekasher/\n\n\nTheme Song Written, Produced, and Performed by Ed Robertson.

Mayim and Moshe explore the idea of the chicken and the egg when it came to his therapy early in life; whether he was exposed to therapy because of exhibited behaviors or whether that exposure fed into those behaviors. We close the episode by coming full circle with a callback to Rick Doblin\u2019s MAPS and the idea that the only way to truly heal from trauma is to go back through it.\n\n\n---\n\nAsk Mayim Anything: https://www.bialikbreakdown.com/#ask-mayim\n\nListen on Spotify: https://open.spotify.com/show/6TgOe2poCdpZtQwKetQmU1\nListen on Apple Podcasts: https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/mayim-bialiks-breakdown/id1546456269\nSign up for Mayim Bialik's Breakdown Newsletter: https://www.bialikbreakdown.com\u200b\u200b\n\nFind Mayim Bialik:\nhttps://www.facebook.com/MissMayim/\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\nhttps://www.twitter.com/MissMayim/\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\nhttps://www.instagram.com/MissMayim/\u200b\u200b\u200b\n\nFind Moshe Kasher:\nhttps://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=100045377343520\nhttps://twitter.com/moshekasher\nhttps://www.instagram.com/moshekasher/\n\n\nTheme Song Written, Produced, and Performed by Ed Robertson.

                    "description": "In this episode, my guest is Noam Sobel, PhD, professor of neurobiology in the department of brain sciences at the Weizmann Institute of Science. Dr. Sobel explains his lab\u2019s research on the biological mechanisms of smell (\u201colfaction\u201d) and how sensing odorants and chemicals in our environment impacts human behavior, cognition, social connections, and hormones. He explains how smell is a crucial component of \u201csocial sensing\u201d and how we use olfaction when meeting new people to determine things about their physiology and psychology, and he explains how this impacts friendships and romantic partners. He explains how smell influences emotions, hormone levels, memories and the relationship between breathing and autonomic homeostasis. He describes how smell-based screening tests can aid disease diagnosis and explains his lab\u2019s work on digitization of smell \u2014 which may soon allow online communication to include \u201csending of odors\u201d via the internet. Dr. Sobel\u2019s work illustrates how sensitive human olfaction is and how it drives much of our biology and behavior. \n\n#HubermanLab #Science #Smell\n\nThank you to our sponsors\nAG1 (Athletic Greens): https://athleticgreens.com/huberman\nROKA: https://roka.com/huberman \nThesis: https://takethesis.com/huberman \nHelix Sleep: https://helixsleep.com/huberman \nInsideTracker: https://insidetracker.com/huberman\n\nSupplements from Momentous\nhttps://www.livemomentous.com/huberman\n\nHuberman Lab Social & Website\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/hubermanlab \nTwitter: https://twitter.com/hubermanlab \nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/hubermanlab \nLinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/in/andrew-huberman\nWebsite: https://hubermanlab.com \nNewsletter: https://hubermanlab.com/neural-network\n\nDr. Noam Sobel\nLab website: https://www.weizmann.ac.il/brain-sciences/worg\nLab Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/odorspaceWORG \nPublications: https://www.weizmann.ac.il/brain-sciences/worg/publications \nTwitter: https://twitter.com/LabWorg \n\nArticles\nThe Age of Olfactory Bulb Neurons in Humans: https://bit.ly/41NMjb6\nThe Privileged Brain Representation of First Olfactory Associations: https://bit.ly/3LGEePP\nMechanisms of scent-tracking in humans: https://go.nature.com/41Sm03w\nMeasuring and Characterizing the Human Nasal Cycle: https://bit.ly/44dqGmi\nHuman non-olfactory cognition phase-locked with inhalation: https://go.nature.com/44iPIQQ\nA social chemosignaling function for human handshaking: https://bit.ly/3Lo5kK6\nThere is chemistry in social chemistry: https://bit.ly/41TVIhq\nMHC-dependent mate preferences in humans: https://bit.ly/41SbgCc\nAn Exteroceptive Block to Pregnancy in the Mouse: https://go.nature.com/3VnxRnN\nFear-Related Chemosignals Modulate Recognition of Fear in Ambiguous Facial Expressions: https://bit.ly/3NqAPpD\nSniffing the human body volatile hexadecanal blocks aggression in men but triggers aggression in women: https://bit.ly/3oQ6NBv\nMenstrual Synchrony and Suppression: https://go.nature.com/3LRF9xf\nRegulation of ovulation by human pheromones: https://go.nature.com/44jODbt\nHuman Tears Contain a Chemosignal: https://bit.ly/41Qmkjr\nWhy Only Humans Shed Emotional Tears: https://bit.ly/41W71pl\nRevisiting the revisit: added evidence for a social chemosignal in human emotional tears: https://bit.ly/44dygNJ\nIncrease of tear volume in dogs after reunion with owners is mediated by oxytocin: https://bit.ly/41W73gX\nAn olfactory self-test effectively screens for COVID-19: https://go.nature.com/3Vj6z1S\n\nOther Resources\nJoachim L\u00f6w video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EOstSv7SrRU \nOsmo: https://osmo.ai \nOdor Space: https://odorspace.weizmann.ac.il \n\nTimestamps\n00:00:00 Dr. Noam Sobel\n00:03:46 Sponsors: ROKA, Thesis, Helix Sleep\n00:06:46 Olfaction Circuits (Smell)\n00:14:49 Loss & Regeneration of Smell, Illness\n00:21:39 Brain Processing of Smell\n00:24:40 Smell & Memories\n00:27:52 Sponsor: AG1 (Athletic Greens)\n00:29:07 Humans & Odor Tracking\n00:39:25 The Alternating Nasal Cycle & Autonomic Nervous System\n00:48:18 Cognitive Processing & Breathing\n00:54:47 Neurodegenerative Diseases & Olfaction \n01:00:12 Congenital Anosmia\n01:05:01 Sponsor: InsideTracker\n01:06:19 Handshaking, Sharing Chemicals & Social Sensing\n01:15:07 Smelling Ourselves & Smelling Others \n01:22:02 Odors & Romantic Attraction\n01:24:58 Vomeronasal Organ, \u201cBruce Effect\u201d & Miscarriage\n01:40:20 Social Chemo-Signals, Fear\n01:50:26 Chemo-Signaling, Aggression & Offspring\n02:03:57 Menstrual Cycle Synchronization\n02:12:11 Sweat, Tears, Emotions & Testosterone\n02:27:46 Science Politics \n02:37:54 Food Odors & Nutritional Value\n02:45:34 Human Perception & Odorant Similarity \n02:52:12 Digitizing Smell, COVID-19 & Smell\n03:05:50 Medical Diagnostic Future & Olfaction Digitization\n03:10:55 Zero-Cost Support, YouTube Feedback, Spotify & Apple Reviews, Sponsors, Momentous, Social Media, Neural Network Newsletter\n\nTitle Card Photo Credit: Mike Blabac - https://www.blabacphoto.com\n\nDisclaimer: https://hubermanlab.com/disclaimer",

It has spawned spin-offs in over 70 countries, in what is now referred to as the 'Got Talent' format, similar to that described by Fremantle of the 'Idol' and 'The X Factor' singing show competition formats.

Cowell stated, \u201cI am very proud that Got Talent is a home grown British show. We owe its success to a group of very talented producers all over the world who have made this happen. And of course amazing talent.\u201d\n\nABOUT TOP 10 TALENT \nTop 10 Talent is a YouTube channel that selects and showcases the best performances from Got Talent, Idol, and X Factor shows around the world from America's Got Talent, Britain's Got Talent, Pilipinas Got Talent, India's Got Talent, Canada's Got Talent, Ukraine's Got Talent and so many more...",

It has spawned spin-offs in over 70 countries, in what is now referred to as the 'Got Talent' format, similar to that described by Fremantle of the 'Idol' and 'The X Factor' singing show competition formats.

Cowell stated, \u201cI am very proud that Got Talent is a home grown British show. We owe its success to a group of very talented producers all over the world who have made this happen. And of course amazing talent.\u201d\n\nABOUT TOP 10 TALENT \nTop 10 Talent is a YouTube channel that selects and showcases the best performances from Got Talent, Idol, and X Factor shows around the world from America's Got Talent, Britain's Got Talent, Pilipinas Got Talent, India's Got Talent, Canada's Got Talent, Ukraine's Got Talent and so many more..."

Cowell stated, \u201cI am very proud that Got Talent is a home grown British show. We owe its success to a group of very talented producers all over the world who have made this happen. And of course amazing talent.\u201d\n\nABOUT TOP 10 TALENT \nTop 10 Talent is a YouTube channel that selects and showcases the best performances from Got Talent, Idol, and X Factor shows around the world from America's Got Talent, Britain's Got Talent, Pilipinas Got Talent, India's Got Talent, Canada's Got Talent, Ukraine's Got Talent and so many more..."

Next, they discuss Ja Morant finally being cleared to play from his season ending shoulder injury and break down how Ja's return along with the addition of Zach Edey sets the Memphis Grizzlies up for a big bounce back season in the NBA's Western Conference. Then, they react to Kevin Durant shutting down trade rumors surrounding a potential departure from the Phoenix Suns and discuss the current state of the Miami Heat, as the once strong culture has spent another offseason not making moves around Jimmy Butler and losing role players like Caleb Martin due to not having a winning culture. Finally, the crew ranks their top 6 teams in the Western Conference for 2025 in a new Paper Champs segment.

                        "description": "Gil's Arena Reacts To Kawhi Leonard Ditching Team USA as Gilbert Arenas & The Gil's Arena Crew discuss Kawhi leaving Team USA to focus on preparing for the upcoming NBA Season and debate if Derrick White was the right person to take his spot over guys like Jaylen Brown & Kyrie Irving. Next, they discuss Ja Morant finally being cleared to play from his season ending shoulder injury and break down how Ja's return along with the addition of Zach Edey sets the Memphis Grizzlies up for a big bounce back season in the NBA's Western Conference. Then, they react to Kevin Durant shutting down trade rumors surrounding a potential departure from the Phoenix Suns and discuss the current state of the Miami Heat, as the once strong culture has spent another offseason not making moves around Jimmy Butler and losing role players like Caleb Martin due to not having a winning culture. Finally, the crew ranks their top 6 teams in the Western Conference for 2025 in a new Paper Champs segment.
