We race the Cadillac V-Series.R (LMDh) versus the Ferrari 296 GTB with Asseto Fiorano package, the McLaren 750S, and the Porsche 911 Turbo S (992.1) through the 1/4 mile \u2014 including a roll race!\n\n=\nThis episode is presented by Valentine One Radar Locator: Find radar before it finds you https://bit.ly/Valentine1_Hagerty\n\nClick here to join the Hagerty Driver's Club: https://bit.ly/Join-HDC-Cammisa-UDRR\n=\n\nIn this video, we perform instrumented 0-to-60 and quarter-mile testing on Cadillac's 2024 Le Mans entry, the Cadillac V-Series.R \u2014 and race it against several roadgoing supercars.\n\nThanks to Balance of Performance (BOP) rules, the Cadillac's 5.5-liter cross plane-crank, 8800-rpm V-8 is limited in output thanks to a restrictor plate \u2014 and its electric hybrid motor is also turned down.\n\nBut there are no BOP rules on the road, so the Cadillac team turned the wick all the way up.\n\nMeanwhile, the road cars were vying for a chance to race the Cadillac. The Ferrari 296 GTB with Assetto Fiorano (sport) package comes with Michelin Pilot Cup 2R tires to deal with the 818 hp from its twin-turbo, 120\u00ba 3-liter V-6 and electric motors. \n\nThe McLaren 720S uses a twin-turbocharged 4.0-liter flat-plane-crank V8. \n\nAnd the rear-engined Porsche 911 sends its 3.7-liter twin-turbo flat-six's power to all four wheels, with a blazing launch that'll keep up with a 1500-hp Bugatti Chiron Pur Sport to 60 mph.\n\nBut can any of them keep up with a Le Mans car? And what about in a rolling race from the Cadillac's 60-kph pit-speed limiter? We find out with Le Mans royalty S\u00e9bastien Bourdais at the wheel!\n\n===\n\nSubscribe to our channel and turn on notifications! http://bit.ly/HagertyYouTube \n\nVisit our website for an insurance quote, to join Hagerty Drivers Club, and for daily automotive news, cars stories, reviews, and opinion: https://www.hagerty.com\n\nStay up to date by signing up for our email newsletters here: https://www.hagerty.com/media/newsletter/ \n\nFollow us on social media:\nFacebook | https://www.facebook.com/Hagerty \nInstagram | https://instagram.com/Hagerty \nTwitter | https://twitter.com/Hagerty \n\nIf you love cars, you belong with us.

                        "description": "Race Car vs. Road Car! We race the Cadillac V-Series.R (LMDh) versus the Ferrari 296 GTB with Asseto Fiorano package, the McLaren 750S, and the Porsche 911 Turbo S (992.1) through the 1/4 mile \u2014 including a roll race!\n\n=\nThis episode is presented by Valentine One Radar Locator: Find radar before it finds you https://bit.ly/Valentine1_Hagerty\n\nClick here to join the Hagerty Driver's Club: https://bit.ly/Join-HDC-Cammisa-UDRR\n=\n\nIn this video, we perform instrumented 0-to-60 and quarter-mile testing on Cadillac's 2024 Le Mans entry, the Cadillac V-Series.R \u2014 and race it against several roadgoing supercars.\n\nThanks to Balance of Performance (BOP) rules, the Cadillac's 5.5-liter cross plane-crank, 8800-rpm V-8 is limited in output thanks to a restrictor plate \u2014 and its electric hybrid motor is also turned down.\n\nBut there are no BOP rules on the road, so the Cadillac team turned the wick all the way up.\n\nMeanwhile, the road cars were vying for a chance to race the Cadillac. The Ferrari 296 GTB with Assetto Fiorano (sport) package comes with Michelin Pilot Cup 2R tires to deal with the 818 hp from its twin-turbo, 120\u00ba 3-liter V-6 and electric motors. \n\nThe McLaren 720S uses a twin-turbocharged 4.0-liter flat-plane-crank V8. \n\nAnd the rear-engined Porsche 911 sends its 3.7-liter twin-turbo flat-six's power to all four wheels, with a blazing launch that'll keep up with a 1500-hp Bugatti Chiron Pur Sport to 60 mph.\n\nBut can any of them keep up with a Le Mans car? And what about in a rolling race from the Cadillac's 60-kph pit-speed limiter? We find out with Le Mans royalty S\u00e9bastien Bourdais at the wheel!\n\n===\n\nSubscribe to our channel and turn on notifications! http://bit.ly/HagertyYouTube \n\nVisit our website for an insurance quote, to join Hagerty Drivers Club, and for daily automotive news, cars stories, reviews, and opinion: https://www.hagerty.com\n\nStay up to date by signing up for our email newsletters here: https://www.hagerty.com/media/newsletter/ \n\nFollow us on social media:\nFacebook | https://www.facebook.com/Hagerty \nInstagram | https://instagram.com/Hagerty \nTwitter | https://twitter.com/Hagerty \n\nIf you love cars, you belong with us.

                    "description": "This is the world\u2019s most insane drift car. A mutated McLaren, it\u2019s the brainchild of \u2018Mad Mike\u2019 Whiddett, with a little help from McLaren experts Lanzante and luxury car specialists O\u2019Gara Coach.\n\nNow, a McLaren P1 drift car would have been silly enough, but \u2018MadMac\u2019 (as it\u2019s affectionately known) fuses a P1 body with a 650S GT3 carbon chassis for the added protection of the latter\u2019s roll cage. Oh, and then whatever McLaren V8 you were expecting has been ditched for a turbocharged, triple-rotor set-up. Peak power is close to four figures\u2026\n\nMyriad other changes have been made to get it drift ready, so here\u2019s \u2018Mad Mike\u2019 himself, plus Lanzante boss Dean Lanzante, together with Top Gear\u2019s Ollie Kew, to give you the full lowdown\u2026\n\nSubscribe to Top Gear for more videos: http://bit.ly/SubscribeToTopGear\n\nWATCH MORE TOP GEAR:\nFirst Looks: https://bit.ly/TGFirstLooks\u00a0\nFirst Drives: https://bit.ly/TGFirstDrives\nAmerican Tuned ft.

                        "description": "This is the world\u2019s most insane drift car. A mutated McLaren, it\u2019s the brainchild of \u2018Mad Mike\u2019 Whiddett, with a little help from McLaren experts Lanzante and luxury car specialists O\u2019Gara Coach.\n\nNow, a McLaren P1 drift car would have been silly enough, but \u2018MadMac\u2019 (as it\u2019s affectionately known) fuses a P1 body with a 650S GT3 carbon chassis for the added protection of the latter\u2019s roll cage. Oh, and then whatever McLaren V8 you were expecting has been ditched for a turbocharged, triple-rotor set-up. Peak power is close to four figures\u2026\n\nMyriad other changes have been made to get it drift ready, so here\u2019s \u2018Mad Mike\u2019 himself, plus Lanzante boss Dean Lanzante, together with Top Gear\u2019s Ollie Kew, to give you the full lowdown\u2026\n\nSubscribe to Top Gear for more videos: http://bit.ly/SubscribeToTopGear\n\nWATCH MORE TOP GEAR:\nFirst Looks: https://bit.ly/TGFirstLooks\u00a0\nFirst Drives: https://bit.ly/TGFirstDrives\nAmerican Tuned ft.

Well, at least nothing terminal.\n\nRoadkill appears on the Motor Trend channel. http://www.youtube.com/motortrend\n\nSubscribe now to make sure you're in on all the action!\nhttp://www.youtube.com/subscription_center?add_user=motortrend\n\nFacebook - http://facebook.com/motortrendmag & http://facebook.com/hotrodmag\nTwitter - http://twitter.com/motortrend\nGoogle+ - https://plus.google.com/101867967859016552744/posts\nWebsite - http://www.motortrend.com & http://www.hotrod.com"

                    "description": "On this episode of Roadkill, it's 2,600 miles, 530 cubic inches, 700 horsepower, six speeds, 17 mpg, and two fun visits with some friends from TV. Last time, on Roadkill Episode 29, we finished our Chrysler-Hemi-powered 1955 Chevrolet gasser in about two weeks of thrashing (it's the same car you saw us take, as a bare shell, to Jim Meyer Racing in Oregon in Episode 8). On this latest episode, we drive it around the block once, then hit the road on a 2,600-mile journey from Los Angeles to the kickoff party of the 2014 HOT ROD Power Tour in Concord, North Carolina. On the way, there's the breakdowns you expect from Roadkill, plus two surprises: a stop at Midwest Street Cars with Justin \"Big Chief\" Shearer and Shawn \"Murder Nova\" Ellington from Street Outlaws, and another with Rutledge Wood from Top Gear USA. \u00a0\n\nThe '55 Chevy is based on an original body with new quarters and floors and a fiberglass decklid and tilt front end, and Lexan windows from ProGlass. It's not in primer: the car was wrapped in satin black by Moody from High-Tech Auto Wraps. The car sits on a complete gasser chassis from Jim Meyer Racing with a solid front axle on leaf springs and a ladder-bar setup with Vicking coilovers on the rear. The rear tires are reproduction Firestone piecrust slicks from Coker tire, and the fronts are just like stock VW Bug tires.\u00a0\n\nThe engine is a 530ci Hemi based on a Mopar Performance crate engine. With a Comp solid roller cam, 10.5:1 compression, homemade 2-1/4-inch headers from a Hedman kit, and Hilborn stack injection powered by a FAST XFI controller and Aeromotive fuel system, it makes 700 horsepower and 700 lb-ft of torque. We were stunned to see 17 mpg a few times on the cross-country trip, especially with absurd 5.43 gears in the Ford 9-inch rear axle. The key to it all is the Tremec T56 Magnum six-speed manual double-overdrive trans installed with a conversion kit from American Powertrain. The car uses a Speedwires harness, charging and starting by Powermaster, and a Braille lightweight battery in the trunk.\n\nRoadkill appears on the Motor Trend channel. http://www.youtube.com/motortrend\n\nSubscribe now to make sure you're in on all the action!\nhttp://www.youtube.com/subscription_center?add_user=motortrend\n\nFacebook - https://www.facebook.com/RoadkillShow, http://facebook.com/motortrendmag & http://facebook.com/hotrodmag\nTwitter - http://twitter.com/motortrend & https://twitter.com/hotrodmagazine\nGoogle + - https://plus.google.com/+motortrend/posts\nWebsite - http://www.motortrend.com & http://www.hotrod.com",

In the first three months of 2024, less than a quarter of car buyers leased vehicles, but more than a third of EV buyers did. By May, nearly 70% of customers getting EVs through dealerships were leased. But EV leasing is problematic for carmakers. While the discounts suggest automakers could be offsetting losses in their EV businesses, the resale values are especially low for them.\n\nChapters:\n00:57 Title card: Why EVs have a leasing problem \n01:04 Chapter 1: Leasing and EVs\n02:54 Chapter 2: Consumers and leasing\n06:10 Chapter 3: Automakers and leasing\n10:02 Chapter 4: Future of EV leasing\n\nProducer: Robert Ferris\nEditor: Darren Geeter \nAnimation: Christina Locopo\nSenior Managing Producer: Tala Hadavi\nAdditional footage: Getty Images, Rivian, Tesla, Ford, GM, Hyundai, Polestar\n\n\u00bb Subscribe to CNBC: https://cnb.cx/SubscribeCNBC\n\u00bb Subscribe to CNBC TV: https://cnb.cx/SubscribeCNBCtelevision\n\nAbout CNBC: From 'Wall Street' to 'Main Street' to award winning original documentaries and Reality TV series, CNBC has you covered.

However, when the global pandemic hit they began converting their abandoned stone barn in Central Portugal to turn into a wonderful tiny stone cottage. Along the way, they have rescued a playful cat called Furrnando and have a wonderful flock of Chickens!"

                    "description": "Peak summer heat is here, and I'll be honest: I want to quit my garden. Garden burnout is common this time of year, and many gardeners slow down or outright quit gardening as a result. This is a mistake, because quitting gardening now means losing the harvests we worked so hard for in spring, and our garden will not be in shape to transition to a fall garden. In this video, I'll show you 6 ways to beat garden burnout that I use to stay strong and keep moving forward.\n\nDon't let gardening burnout get you down. By following these gardening tips, you can push through the hot weather and heat waves. If you do this, you will be rewarded with an incredible garden to transition to the fall gardening season. Fall gardening is key to helping seasonal depression in my experience, and many vegetables you plant in fall will stand into winter so you'll have a winter garden, too.

                        "description": "Peak summer heat is here, and I'll be honest: I want to quit my garden. Garden burnout is common this time of year, and many gardeners slow down or outright quit gardening as a result. This is a mistake, because quitting gardening now means losing the harvests we worked so hard for in spring, and our garden will not be in shape to transition to a fall garden. In this video, I'll show you 6 ways to beat garden burnout that I use to stay strong and keep moving forward.\n\nDon't let gardening burnout get you down. By following these gardening tips, you can push through the hot weather and heat waves. If you do this, you will be rewarded with an incredible garden to transition to the fall gardening season. Fall gardening is key to helping seasonal depression in my experience, and many vegetables you plant in fall will stand into winter so you'll have a winter garden, too. This strategy has been key to manage my seasonal affective disorder, which many of us suffer with in the cold weather.\n\nDrip Irrigation Install Videos: https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PL1gY7BoYBGIHHHsx0JPcYgD4xXzA96usL&si=XhCNykJaPix_p4t5\nHow To Use Shade Cloth: https://youtu.be/cO-U1wYGZ8Q?si=gPLhuhM5OLj4qjGD\n\nMy Drip Depot Affiliate store** for all your drip irrigation needs: https://aff.dripdepot.com/aff/idevaffiliate.php?id=372\n\nI use the following products* to grow vegetables and fruit trees in my garden:\nShade Cloth (Many Sizes): https://amzn.to/4bLbv72\nTarps (Many Sizes): https://amzn.to/3xVXlS2\nGrow Bags (Many Sizes): https://amzn.to/3x4bJXO\nInsect Netting (Many Sizes): https://amzn.to/3TYm134\nDrip Irrigation Sprinkler Hose (Many Sizes): https://amzn.to/4eQSSki \nWeed Barrier (Many Sizes): https://amzn.to/4dUWVeC\nJobe's Organic Vegetable Fertilizer (4lbs): https://amzn.to/45YHmh2\nEspoma Plant Tone (36lbs): https://amzn.to/3Zgk98f\nJobe's Bone Meal (4lb): https://amzn.to/3uC5klp\nEspoma Bone Meal (10lb): https://amzn.to/3X9s88a\nAlaska Fish Fertilizer (Gallon): https://amzn.to/3XP5EHU\nAlaska Fish Fertilizer (Quart): https://amzn.to/3wTE7Ms\nJack's Blossom Booster 10-30-20 (1.5lb): https://amzn.to/3KyPTzg\nJack's All Purpose 20-20-20 (1.5lb): https://amzn.to/3MQ4I2A\nJack's / JR Peters All Purpose 20-20-20 (25lb): https://amzn.to/44DUV58\nJack's Blossom Booster 10-30-20 (25lb): https://amzn.to/45FIuXh\nFull Amazon Store: https://www.amazon.com/shop/themillennialgardener\n\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\n0:00     Why I Want To Quit Gardening Right Now\n3:28     Stopping Garden Burnout: Tip #1\n4:47     Stopping Garden Burnout: Tip #2\n6:01     Stopping Garden Burnout: Tip #3\n8:01     Stopping Garden Burnout: Tip #4\n10:23   Stopping Garden Burnout: Tip #5\n11:47   Stopping Garden Burnout: Tip #6\n15:22   Adventures With Dale\n\nIf you have any questions about how to stop garden burnout before it starts, want to know about the things I grow in my raised bed vegetable garden and edible landscaping food forest, are looking for more gardening tips and tricks and garden hacks, have questions about vegetable gardening and organic gardening in general, or want to share some DIY and \"how to\" garden tips and gardening hacks of your own, please ask in the Comments below!\n\n*************************\nVISIT MY AMAZON STOREFRONT FOR PRODUCTS I USE MOST OFTEN IN MY GARDEN*\nhttps://www.amazon.com/shop/themillennialgardener\n\n*************************\nVISIT MY MERCHANDISE STORE\nhttps://shop.spreadshirt.com/themillennialgardener\n\n*************************\nSUPPORT MY SECOND CHANNEL!\nhttps://www.youtube.com/c/2MinuteGardenTips\n\n*************************\nEQUIPMENT I MOST OFTEN USE IN MY GARDEN*:\n\nSouthern Ag Liquid Copper Fungicide https://amzn.to/2HTCKRd\nSouthern Ag Natural Pyrethrin Concentrate https://amzn.to/2UHSNGE\nMonterey Organic Spinosad Concentrate https://amzn.to/3qOU8f5\nSafer Brand Caterpillar Killer (BT Concentrate) https://amzn.to/2SMXL8D\n\nWeed Barrier with UV Resistance  https://amzn.to/3yp3MaJ\nOrganza Bags (Fig-size) https://amzn.to/3AyaMUz\nOrganza Bags (Tomato-size) https://amzn.to/36fy4Re\n\nInjection Molded Nursery Pots https://amzn.to/3AucVAB\nHeavy Duty Plant Grow Bags https://amzn.to/2UqvsgC\n6.5 Inch Hand Pruner Pruning Shears https://amzn.to/3jHI1yL\nJapanese Pruning Saw with Blade https://amzn.to/3wjpw6o\n\nDouble Tomato Hooks with Twine https://amzn.to/3Awptr9\nString Trellis Tomato Support Clips https://amzn.to/3wiBjlB\nExpandable Vinyl Garden Tape https://amzn.to/3jL7JCI\n\n*************************\nSOCIAL MEDIA\nFollow Me on TWITTER (@NCGardening) https://twitter.com/NCGardening\nFollow Me on INSTAGRAM https://www.instagram.com/millennialgardener/\n\n*************************\nABOUT MY GARDEN\nLocation: Southeastern NC, Brunswick County (Wilmington area)\n34.1\u00b0N Latitude\nZone 8B\n\n*************************\n*As an Amazon Associate, I earn from qualifying purchases.\n**My Drip Depot affiliate store earns me commissions at no cost to you.\n\u00a9 The Millennial Gardener\n\n#gardening #garden #gardeningtips #burnout #vegetablegardening"

                    "description": "Let's talk about how to use Epsom salt in the garden and on your potted plants.  In the last couple videos about hydrangea color and blooms, I mentioned Epsom salt and it's use in the garden.  Well, the one thing I forget to mention was how much to use and how often.  In this video, I'm going to cover all of that.  Epsom salt contains magnesium and sulfur, which are vital for healthy plant growth.  They work together to give the plant a more rich green color, stronger roots and shoots, and more robust flowers.  It is a natural fertilizer that can be found just about anywhere for next to nothing and is safe to use in the home.\n\n\n\nFertilizer video 1:  https://youtu.be/e5Nx93MBGUw\nFertilizer video 2:  https://youtu.be/vNyRVD6N4H8\n\n\n\nGo to the website:  https://propagateplantslikeapro.com\nCheck out my Wife's Channel:  https://bit.ly/3hfX8fk\n\n\n\nProducts I Use Frequently:     \n     Hormodin #3 Rooting Powder:  https://amzn.to/3n5F9tS     \n     Clonex Rooting Gel:  https://amzn.to/37WqhJF     \n     Dip N Grow Rooting Liquid:  https://amzn.to/2WXIU9Q     \n     Corona Shears:  https://amzn.to/2WUS2Mt     \n     Leaf Trimming Shears:  https://amzn.to/38KrVxt     \n     Orchard Lopper:  https://amzn.to/2Jt5pAo     \n     Propagation Tote:  https://amzn.to/34WIdlB     \n     Propagation Dome and Heat Mat Combo:  https://amzn.to/37WqHQf     \n     Indoor Grow Light:  https://amzn.to/2WSxJiT     \n     Grow Tent:  https://amzn.to/37X01Pj\n\n\nInstagram:  https://www.instagram.com/mike.kincaid\nPropagation Group:  https://www.facebook.com/groups/346884795717132/\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/kincaidsnursery \nTwitter: https://twitter.com/kincaidmj\n\nMusic:  DJ Quads  https://soundcloud.com/aka-dj-quads",

                        "description": "Let's talk about how to use Epsom salt in the garden and on your potted plants.  In the last couple videos about hydrangea color and blooms, I mentioned Epsom salt and it's use in the garden.  Well, the one thing I forget to mention was how much to use and how often.  In this video, I'm going to cover all of that.  Epsom salt contains magnesium and sulfur, which are vital for healthy plant growth.  They work together to give the plant a more rich green color, stronger roots and shoots, and more robust flowers.  It is a natural fertilizer that can be found just about anywhere for next to nothing and is safe to use in the home.\n\n\n\nFertilizer video 1:  https://youtu.be/e5Nx93MBGUw\nFertilizer video 2:  https://youtu.be/vNyRVD6N4H8\n\n\n\nGo to the website:  https://propagateplantslikeapro.com\nCheck out my Wife's Channel:  https://bit.ly/3hfX8fk\n\n\n\nProducts I Use Frequently:     \n     Hormodin #3 Rooting Powder:  https://amzn.to/3n5F9tS     \n     Clonex Rooting Gel:  https://amzn.to/37WqhJF     \n     Dip N Grow Rooting Liquid:  https://amzn.to/2WXIU9Q     \n     Corona Shears:  https://amzn.to/2WUS2Mt     \n     Leaf Trimming Shears:  https://amzn.to/38KrVxt     \n     Orchard Lopper:  https://amzn.to/2Jt5pAo     \n     Propagation Tote:  https://amzn.to/34WIdlB     \n     Propagation Dome and Heat Mat Combo:  https://amzn.to/37WqHQf     \n     Indoor Grow Light:  https://amzn.to/2WSxJiT     \n     Grow Tent:  https://amzn.to/37X01Pj\n\n\nInstagram:  https://www.instagram.com/mike.kincaid\nPropagation Group:  https://www.facebook.com/groups/346884795717132/\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/kincaidsnursery \nTwitter: https://twitter.com/kincaidmj\n\nMusic:  DJ Quads  https://soundcloud.com/aka-dj-quads"

Well, in today\u2019s video, I\u2019ll show you how you can completely transform a drab room all by yourself in one weekend! You don\u2019t need an interior designer, carpenter, or a large budget to make drastic improvements in your space. Projects in today\u2019s video include creating large diptych wall art, a hack for hanging large artwork, hanging peel and stick wallpaper and wood trim to create a headboard/focal wall, transforming old furniture and hardware, updating an outdated ceiling light with a thrift store basket (and a hack for creating space for a larger shade on your existing ceiling hardware), and adding fabrics and decor from the thrift store. Not only is this a budget rental friendly makeover, but it\u2019s one that can be completed in less than 48 hours! \n\n\nMy channel home page: https://youtube.com/c/canterburycottage\nMy online store: https://canterburycottageshop.com/\nAlso, check out Canterbury Cottage on Pinterest and Tik Tok.\nCanterbury Cottage Facebook Page: https://www.facebook.com/CanterburyCottagePeoria/\nFor business collaborations, contact  juliana@thoughtleaders.io\nFacebook Group: https://www.facebook.com/groups/2916118271958839/\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/canterburycottage/\nFor more DIY ideas and projects: youtube.com/@CanterburyCottage\n\nMy Amazon storefront: https://amazon.com/shop/canterburycottage\n\nOrder IOD products here: \nhttps://www.juliesdesignsandsigns.com/?aff=3\n\nLandscape Art/Diptych Art:\nhttps://imgur.com/a/XNAAMhR",

                    "description": "After wrapping up their season in Azores Portugal, the team switches things up a bit and makes a quick 3 day pit stop in Nova Scotia before heading home. There they meet lead crewman OB Morton and legendary fisherman James Roberts to have their go at a new species, Giant Bluefin Tuna. \n\nOB and James have spent nearly every season in Nova Scotia over the past 15 years catching some bluefin that tip the scales at over 1000 pounds. The two have been trying to take Anthony for years. With a down motor ending the season early in Portugal, it was the perfect excuse to spend a few days trying out something new. \n\nEach day starts early and cold. With temperatures lower than 0 Celsius some mornings. The team keeps a sharp eye out driving in the dark to the marina every morning. They\u2019re deep in moose country now. The next 3 days produce 6 giant bluefin with one estimated at 850 pounds. \n\nKevin and David get a crack at the fun and Anthony gets a feel for 70+ pounds of drag on a new kind of giant. This trip wraps up the 2023 season for the team. Next stop, Ascension Island.

                        "description": "After wrapping up their season in Azores Portugal, the team switches things up a bit and makes a quick 3 day pit stop in Nova Scotia before heading home. There they meet lead crewman OB Morton and legendary fisherman James Roberts to have their go at a new species, Giant Bluefin Tuna. \n\nOB and James have spent nearly every season in Nova Scotia over the past 15 years catching some bluefin that tip the scales at over 1000 pounds. The two have been trying to take Anthony for years. With a down motor ending the season early in Portugal, it was the perfect excuse to spend a few days trying out something new. \n\nEach day starts early and cold. With temperatures lower than 0 Celsius some mornings. The team keeps a sharp eye out driving in the dark to the marina every morning. They\u2019re deep in moose country now. The next 3 days produce 6 giant bluefin with one estimated at 850 pounds. \n\nKevin and David get a crack at the fun and Anthony gets a feel for 70+ pounds of drag on a new kind of giant. This trip wraps up the 2023 season for the team. Next stop, Ascension Island. Stay tuned to see how our team gets to an island that hasn\u2019t been visited in 8 years by outsider fisherman. \n\nFor more information about the team, fleet, and tour, head over to badcompanyfishingadventures.com or become part of our crew and join the Adventure at badcocrew.com. \n\nBADCO Crew mobile app coming soon to the Apple and Android App Stores. #badcocrew\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nCONTENTS OF THIS VIDEO:\n00:00 - The team arrives to Nova Scotia\n02:53 - Getting up at 4am for first day of fishing\n04:57 - Anthony describes the new territory\n05:57 - Fish on!\n09:04 - Leadering a 600+lb bluefin tuna\n11:04 - Anthony fishes his arse off on second one for the day\n13:17 - Learn more about the tackle in our Tackle Talk video\n15:23 - Introduction to Captain Betty \n17:44 - Cameraman David Lassley reels one in\n19:47 - Captain Kevin Bohannon takes the seat\n22:50 - Anthony pulls in PB bluefin\n24:57 - Storm rolls in and the team departs\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nFEATURING: \nAnthony Hsieh\nCaptain Kevin Bohannon\nOB Morton\nDavid Lassley\nCaptain James Roberts\n\nVideography by David Lassley | IG @David_lassley\nVideo edit by Tanner Matthews | IG @filmpacific"

But luckily I made it up! Since I was late in the bookings I went on a different charter than my Dad and our Friends. We thought it might be a little weird for me to go off on a charter on my own but it turned out to be a blessing in disguise.\n\nI was with a group of three from Michigan, and a group of two from Minnesota. Everyone on the boat was super cool people.\n\nWatch and see how we fair in our fishing for big Halibut!\nMore to come... stay tuned for the more of this trip up to AK.",

But luckily I made it up! Since I was late in the bookings I went on a different charter than my Dad and our Friends. We thought it might be a little weird for me to go off on a charter on my own but it turned out to be a blessing in disguise.\n\nI was with a group of three from Michigan, and a group of two from Minnesota. Everyone on the boat was super cool people.\n\nWatch and see how we fair in our fishing for big Halibut!\nMore to come... stay tuned for the more of this trip up to AK."

                    "description": "In this video, Jaime shows how to cook 5 make-ahead breakfasts that are delicious and easy meals for you to bring on your next camping trip. Thanks for watching!\n\nBreakfast Burritos (serves 4)\n1 cup frozen tater tots\n4 eggs\n1/2 LB breakfast sausage\n3/4 cup shredded cheddar cheese\nSalt & pepper to taste\n4 8-inch flour tortillas\n\nBake tater tots according to package instructions. Heat olive oil over medium-high heat in large skillet. Cook sausage for 4-5 minutes then transfer to a bowl. Combine eggs, milk, & salt in a bowl & whisk. Cook eggs over medium-high heat, gently scraping the bottom. Add cooked eggs to the bowl with the sausage. Add in cheddar cheese & cooked tater tots. Season to taste with salt/pepper & mix. Spread some of the filling mixture onto a tortilla. Wrap it up & place it seam-side down on the foil & wrap. Place in a Ziplock bag & freeze. To heat at camp, place foil-wrapped burritos on hot coals or grill grate until warm.\n\nEgg Muffin Cups (serves 6)\n5 eggs\n1/4 LB cooked bacon, crumbled\n1 cup grated cheddar cheese\n1 tsp Italian seasoning\nSalt & pepper to taste\n\nPreheat oven to 400\u00b0 F / 200\u00b0 C. Break eggs into a bowl & beat with salt/pepper. Add in cheese, bacon, pepper, Italian seasoning, & stir. Divide the mixture into muffin cups. Bake until set (10-15 minutes). Let cool completely then individually wrap & store in the refrigerator. To reheat, throw the wrapped egg cups on a grill grate until warm.\n\nBreakfast Casserole (serves 12)\nIngredients:\n4 cups crusty bread, cubed\n1 LB pork sausage, casings removed\n1 tsp Italian seasoning\n3/4 cup yellow onion\n2 garlic cloves, minced\n2 cups bell peppers\n1 cup mushrooms\n1 cup fresh spinach\n12 eggs\nSalt & pepper\n2/3 cup milk\n1 cup shredded cheddar cheese\n\nGrease an oven-safe dish & arrange bread cubes on the bottom. Heat olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Add sausage and Italian seasoning, breaking up sausage as it cooks. Add onion, garlic, bell peppers, mushrooms, & spinach; cook 5-6 minutes. Spread cooked mixture in an even layer on top of bread. Whisk eggs, salt, pepper, milk, & cheese. Evenly pour over the sausage & veggie mixture. Cover the casserole with aluminum foil & refrigerate for at least 30 minutes, up to 24 hours. Preheat oven to 375\u00b0 F / 190\u00b0 C. Bake the casserole uncovered until a toothpick comes out clean (40-45 minutes). Let cool completely before storing in refrigerator. Reheat 25-30 minutes on the stove or over the fire.\n\nOvernight Oats (serves 1)\nIngredients:\n1/2 cup steel-cut oats\n1/2 cup milk\n2-3 tsp green yogurt\n2-3 tsp peanut butter\nChia seeds\nBlueberries\nOptional: granola and honey for topping\n\nAdd oats & milk to a mason jar or small food container; stir until combined. Add Greek yogurt, peanut butter, & chia seeds; stir after each addition. Add blueberries & stir. Refrigerate for at least 8 hours. When ready to eat, top with granola, honey, or more fruit.\n\nBanana Bread (serves 8)\nIngredients:\n2 cups all-purpose flour\n1 tsp baking powder\n1 tsp baking soda\n1 tsp salt\n1 cup white sugar\n1/2 cup butter, softened\n3 ripe bananas\n2 eggs\n1 tbsp milk\n1/4 tsp vanilla extract\nOptional: 1 cup walnuts, 1/3 cup chocolate chips\n\nPreheat oven to 325\u00b0 F / 165\u00b0 C & grease a loaf pan. Whisk together flour, baking powder, baking soda, & salt in a medium bowl; set aside. Beat sugar & butter with a mixer in a large bowl until smooth. Add bananas, mash with a fork, & mix until combined. Add eggs, one at a time, beating well after each addition. Stir in milk & vanilla.

                    "description": "In this video we show how to make 5 delicious make ahead camping snacks that you will love! All of these are super simple and easy to make, and travel really well. The beef jerky takes some work for sure, but it's absolutely worth it! Thanks for watching! \n\nFollow us on Instagram! https://www.instagram.com/wherewewild\n\nCheck out our Amazon Shop for all of our favorite gear! http://amazon.com/shop/wherewewild\n\nTRAIL MIX:\n\nWe used almonds, roasted peanuts, cashews, raisins, and chocolate M&M\u2019s, but you can customize this with anything you\u2019d like. Nuts and dried fruit, swap out the M&M\u2019s for your favorite candy pieces. The options are endless!\n\nENERGY BITES:\n\n5 pitted medjool dates\n1/4 cup raw cashews\n1/2 scoop chocolate protein powder\n1 tablespoon dark chocolate chips\n1 tablespoon cashew butter.\nOptional: 2 tablespoons shredded coconut \n\nPlace all ingredients in a food processor (we used our Nutri-bullet) and mix until you have a crumbly mixture that will stick together if pressed.\n\nRemove the mixture from the food processer and roll into 6 evenly-sized balls. *Optional: roll the bites into the shredded coconut.\n\nTransfer the energy bits into an airtight container or ziplock bag and either store at room temperate for a softer texture or in the fridge for a more firm texture. These will keep for up to 5 days.\n\nPUPPY CHOW:\n\n10 cups Rice Chex cereal (a family-size box is perfect)\n4 tablespoons butter\n2/3 cup peanut butter\n1 cup chocolate chips \n2 cups powdered sugar\n\nAdd peanut butter, chocolate chips, and butter into a microwave-safe bowl. Microwave for 1 minute on high, stir, and continue microwaving in 20-second increments (stirring in between) until the mixture is smooth.\n\nPlace Chex cereal into a large mixture bowl. Pour the chocolate/peanut butter/butter mixture over the cereal and gently mix to cover all cereal pieces evenly. A spatula works perfect for this step.\n\nPlace half of the cereal mixture into a ziplock bag and add 1 cup of powder sugar to the bag. Shake until all pieces are covered evenly. Dump everything onto a parchment-paper-lined baking sheet to let everything cool\n\nRepeat for the remaining half of the cereal mixture.\n\nStore in a ziplock bag or air-tight container at either room temperature or in the fridge.\n\nBANANA WRAPS:\n\nWhole Wheat Tortillas\nBananas\nNut Butter of Choice (Peanut, Almond, Cashew) and/or Nutella\n\nPlace a tortilla on a plate and spread nut butter in the middle, keeping away from the edges.\n\nPeel a banana and place it in the middle of the tortilla.\n\nWrap the tortilla like you would a burrito and enjoy!\n\nBEEF JERKY:\nThe best cuts of steak to use are Eye Of Round, Top Round, Bottom Round, or Flank Steak.\n\nCut the meat into strips of the size you prefer, and be sure to trim off all of the fat.\n\nMarinade for 2 pounds of meat:\n1/2 Cup Soy sauce\n2 Tablespoons Worcestershire sauce\n2 Teaspoons ground Black Pepper\n1 Teaspoon Liquid Smoke (Hickory)\n1 Teaspoon Onion Powder\n1 Teaspoon Salt\n1/2 Teaspoon Garlic Powder\n\nUse a mixing bowl or ziplock bag to coat the meat and refrigerate overnight.\n\nLay the meat out on paper towels and pat completely dry. Also pat each individual piece once more before placing it in the air fryer or on your oven rack. It needs to be as dry as possible.\n\nIn the Air Fryer, we set the temperature to 150 Degrees Fahrenheit, and cooked for around 3 hours. Checking in on the meat after 2 and a half hours, and allowing it to cook for 15 more minutes at a time until it appeared to be done. \n\nIn the oven, we set the temperature to 170 Degrees Fahrenheit, and cooked the meat for around 3 hours as well, checking it a few times until we thought it was done.\n\nCooking times may vary depending on the thickness of the meat you are using and how your individual air fryer or oven cooks, so keep an eye on the progress.\n\nYou don't want there to be any moisture left in the meat, although we found that some oil may still be visible even when the meat is done. You want it to have a nice bend to it, with no moisture squeezing out from it. If it snaps very easily while trying to bend it, it's probably overdone.\n\n\n#camping #campinglife #campingfood #outdoors",

                        "description": "In this video we show how to make 5 delicious make ahead camping snacks that you will love! All of these are super simple and easy to make, and travel really well. The beef jerky takes some work for sure, but it's absolutely worth it! Thanks for watching! \n\nFollow us on Instagram! https://www.instagram.com/wherewewild\n\nCheck out our Amazon Shop for all of our favorite gear! http://amazon.com/shop/wherewewild\n\nTRAIL MIX:\n\nWe used almonds, roasted peanuts, cashews, raisins, and chocolate M&M\u2019s, but you can customize this with anything you\u2019d like. Nuts and dried fruit, swap out the M&M\u2019s for your favorite candy pieces. The options are endless!\n\nENERGY BITES:\n\n5 pitted medjool dates\n1/4 cup raw cashews\n1/2 scoop chocolate protein powder\n1 tablespoon dark chocolate chips\n1 tablespoon cashew butter.\nOptional: 2 tablespoons shredded coconut \n\nPlace all ingredients in a food processor (we used our Nutri-bullet) and mix until you have a crumbly mixture that will stick together if pressed.\n\nRemove the mixture from the food processer and roll into 6 evenly-sized balls. *Optional: roll the bites into the shredded coconut.\n\nTransfer the energy bits into an airtight container or ziplock bag and either store at room temperate for a softer texture or in the fridge for a more firm texture. These will keep for up to 5 days.\n\nPUPPY CHOW:\n\n10 cups Rice Chex cereal (a family-size box is perfect)\n4 tablespoons butter\n2/3 cup peanut butter\n1 cup chocolate chips \n2 cups powdered sugar\n\nAdd peanut butter, chocolate chips, and butter into a microwave-safe bowl. Microwave for 1 minute on high, stir, and continue microwaving in 20-second increments (stirring in between) until the mixture is smooth.\n\nPlace Chex cereal into a large mixture bowl. Pour the chocolate/peanut butter/butter mixture over the cereal and gently mix to cover all cereal pieces evenly. A spatula works perfect for this step.\n\nPlace half of the cereal mixture into a ziplock bag and add 1 cup of powder sugar to the bag. Shake until all pieces are covered evenly. Dump everything onto a parchment-paper-lined baking sheet to let everything cool\n\nRepeat for the remaining half of the cereal mixture.\n\nStore in a ziplock bag or air-tight container at either room temperature or in the fridge.\n\nBANANA WRAPS:\n\nWhole Wheat Tortillas\nBananas\nNut Butter of Choice (Peanut, Almond, Cashew) and/or Nutella\n\nPlace a tortilla on a plate and spread nut butter in the middle, keeping away from the edges.\n\nPeel a banana and place it in the middle of the tortilla.\n\nWrap the tortilla like you would a burrito and enjoy!\n\nBEEF JERKY:\nThe best cuts of steak to use are Eye Of Round, Top Round, Bottom Round, or Flank Steak.\n\nCut the meat into strips of the size you prefer, and be sure to trim off all of the fat.\n\nMarinade for 2 pounds of meat:\n1/2 Cup Soy sauce\n2 Tablespoons Worcestershire sauce\n2 Teaspoons ground Black Pepper\n1 Teaspoon Liquid Smoke (Hickory)\n1 Teaspoon Onion Powder\n1 Teaspoon Salt\n1/2 Teaspoon Garlic Powder\n\nUse a mixing bowl or ziplock bag to coat the meat and refrigerate overnight.\n\nLay the meat out on paper towels and pat completely dry. Also pat each individual piece once more before placing it in the air fryer or on your oven rack. It needs to be as dry as possible.\n\nIn the Air Fryer, we set the temperature to 150 Degrees Fahrenheit, and cooked for around 3 hours. Checking in on the meat after 2 and a half hours, and allowing it to cook for 15 more minutes at a time until it appeared to be done. \n\nIn the oven, we set the temperature to 170 Degrees Fahrenheit, and cooked the meat for around 3 hours as well, checking it a few times until we thought it was done.\n\nCooking times may vary depending on the thickness of the meat you are using and how your individual air fryer or oven cooks, so keep an eye on the progress.\n\nYou don't want there to be any moisture left in the meat, although we found that some oil may still be visible even when the meat is done. You want it to have a nice bend to it, with no moisture squeezing out from it. If it snaps very easily while trying to bend it, it's probably overdone.\n\n\n#camping #campinglife #campingfood #outdoors"

(Hidden Underground Tunnel Reveals Mysterious Clues and Riddles) and Game Master Take Down Project Zorgo Date Revealed! (Underground Tunnel leads to Top Secret Cave) Matt and Rebecca leave the escape room in real life. Matt and Rebecca spy on a secret meeting between Game Master and three mystery men ninjas after we found a hidden treasure map in an underground tunnel. Rebecca followed the GM inside the passageway to an abandoned cave with a top secret control room.  Many people think Rebecca is still hypnotized using CODE 10 in real life after taking the lie detector mystery mixture.  When Rebecca and Matt decode the riddle and solve the December date they realize their next step is to trap the Pumpkin Patch spy. Using the hidden camera surveillance footage they find PP\u2019s hideout filled with mystery boxes and a laptop. We set up spy gadgets and GoPros to trap PP and when he arrives we wore undercover disguises to hide our identity.

(GM Rescue in 24 hours at Quadrant Headquarters), then Matt and Rebecca had a Game Master Experiment on Matt at 3am (RZ twin Hypnotized him with Quadrant Device). To win back our trust, Daniel agrees to trick RZ twin by pretending to join the Quadrant while at our safe house. We need to find out information about the hidden mystery device and the event date of E2. Rebecca and Matt convince our cameraman to call the Quadrant member and she gives him coordinates for a secret meeting. I hope the next 24 hours will convince her he wants to defeat the Game Master and work as a spy for this challenge. To keep him safe, we bring our spy gadgets and ninja gadgets and begin spying in a hidden location. When she arrives, she does a face reveal and we see her red eyes under the mask. We need him to be last to leave so our undercover disguise isn\u2019t revealed to RZ twin. Before leaving, she tells Daniel his first mission is to trap Rebecca Zamolo. I\u2019m not sure if he wins $10,000 like Chad Wild Clay and Vy Qwaint for following the plan or if she\u2019ll make me take a lie detector test, but we need to keep the GM safe and stop E2.

(E2 Date Reveal Clues Found at Secret Meeting) then Matt and Rebecca uploaded Daniel Traps Rebecca Zamolo for Game Master Spy! (Last to Drop Wins $10,000 Challenge). After Daniel our cameraman attended a secret meeting with RZ twin we uncovered the truth that they want Rebecca while spying with our spy ninja gadgets. I pretended to lose the last to drop wins $10,000 Morgz challenge and our cameraman took me to the Quadrant safe house. I end up spending the night inside a tiny room until they made me take a lie detector test. Thankfully, the Game Master hid a tiny antidote device to use against the Lie Detector mixture so I wouldn\u2019t have to reveal the truth. I realized that we must defeat the hacker quadrant in this battle royale and escape using our spy ninja training like Chad Wild Clay. Matt became hypnotized by the music and our camera man had to use his hacker skills to turn off the computer so we could complete our plan and escape. We try escaping but it turns into a hacker chase. Do you think we\u2019ll be able to help the real Game Master and stop E2?

(24 Hour Music Video Challenge) https://youtu.be/fUbMZRIhJ7I\nRZ twin does a face reveal after Daniel traps Rebecca 24 hours overnight while pretending to be a Quadrant spy. \n\u25b6 Last Game Master clues and riddles to solve: https://goo.gl/y2kSct\n\u25b6 New ZamFam & Matt Merch! https://rebeccazamolo.com \n\nRebecca Zamolo created Daniel Wins Trust from RZ Twin to Defeat Game Master! (E2 Date Reveal Clues Found at Secret Meeting) then Matt and Rebecca uploaded Daniel Traps Rebecca Zamolo for Game Master Spy! (Last to Drop Wins $10,000 Challenge). After Daniel our cameraman attended a secret meeting with RZ twin we uncovered the truth that they want Rebecca while spying with our spy ninja gadgets. I pretended to lose the last to drop wins $10,000 Morgz challenge and our cameraman took me to the Quadrant safe house. I end up spending the night inside a tiny room until they made me take a lie detector test. Thankfully, the Game Master hid a tiny antidote device to use against the Lie Detector mixture so I wouldn\u2019t have to reveal the truth. I realized that we must defeat the hacker quadrant in this battle royale and escape using our spy ninja training like Chad Wild Clay. Matt became hypnotized by the music and our camera man had to use his hacker skills to turn off the computer so we could complete our plan and escape. We try escaping but it turns into a hacker chase. Do you think we\u2019ll be able to help the real Game Master and stop E2?

(24 Hour Music Video Challenge) https://youtu.be/fUbMZRIhJ7I\nRebecca Zamolo completed a 24 hour challenge in a tiny space but found surveillance footage in the morning that the RZ twin broke in overnight.\n\u25b6 Last Game Master secret hidden riddle to solve: https://goo.gl/J9c6VG\n\u25b6 New ZamFam Merch is here! https://rebeccazamolo.com \n\nRebecca Zamolo and Matt had a battle royale with Game Master spy ninjas from the Quadrant that gave clues about the event date. With this new information my husband Matt attended a secret Game Master meeting that revealed their plan to find me. In today\u2019s video, I packed spy gadgets to spend 24hrs in a tiny safe house to stay hidden from the Quadrant. Even though we didn\u2019t want him to, Daniel told the GM our location and we received a mysterious mixture with a letter from him. We realized when we unboxed the blue liquid that it was one of the ingredients for the lie detector potion we previously broke. Hopefully we\u2019ll be able to get back to his laboratory and create the mixture before Feb. 23rd.  We made a detective board with all the clues we have received to determine why the RZ twin kept spying on us while working undercover for the Quadrant ninjas. Is she working with CWC and Vy Qwaint? Matt explored upstairs after hearing a noise, but it was empty and I really hope it wasn\u2019t a real ghost. After we ate pizza for dinner the soda made us tired so we fell asleep. When we woke up we realized the RZ twin has broke in and taken the clue board and blue liquid. Luckily, the container was a decoy and we still had the real mixture in my spy gadget backpack. Do you think we can safely get back to the escape room lab in time?

                        "description": "New BEST FRIENDS SONG Reveals SECRET Hidden Cameras in HOUSE! (24 Hour Music Video Challenge) https://youtu.be/fUbMZRIhJ7I\nRebecca Zamolo completed a 24 hour challenge in a tiny space but found surveillance footage in the morning that the RZ twin broke in overnight.\n\u25b6 Last Game Master secret hidden riddle to solve: https://goo.gl/J9c6VG\n\u25b6 New ZamFam Merch is here! https://rebeccazamolo.com \n\nRebecca Zamolo and Matt had a battle royale with Game Master spy ninjas from the Quadrant that gave clues about the event date. With this new information my husband Matt attended a secret Game Master meeting that revealed their plan to find me. In today\u2019s video, I packed spy gadgets to spend 24hrs in a tiny safe house to stay hidden from the Quadrant. Even though we didn\u2019t want him to, Daniel told the GM our location and we received a mysterious mixture with a letter from him. We realized when we unboxed the blue liquid that it was one of the ingredients for the lie detector potion we previously broke. Hopefully we\u2019ll be able to get back to his laboratory and create the mixture before Feb. 23rd.  We made a detective board with all the clues we have received to determine why the RZ twin kept spying on us while working undercover for the Quadrant ninjas. Is she working with CWC and Vy Qwaint? Matt explored upstairs after hearing a noise, but it was empty and I really hope it wasn\u2019t a real ghost. After we ate pizza for dinner the soda made us tired so we fell asleep. When we woke up we realized the RZ twin has broke in and taken the clue board and blue liquid. Luckily, the container was a decoy and we still had the real mixture in my spy gadget backpack. Do you think we can safely get back to the escape room lab in time?

First Rebecca Zamolo uploaded \"Saying yes to Abby Lee for 24 hours in a dance moms challenge.\" Next Matt and Rebecca created \"We opened a haunted mystery box at 3am in a last to fall asleep wins challenge.\" Finally the Game Master Network made \"Bubble gum blowing challenge.\" Now Rebecca has a secret she has been hiding and her cousin Maddie is about to discover it. When Rebecca reveals there is a secret hidden dollhouse in her closet it is surprising for Maddie.  First they have to go through 100 layers of wrapping paper but once inside it is magical. The boys vs girls challenge heats up when Matt goes on a wild goose chase to find the missing mystery box in the park.  Daniel is sad because he is reminded of his crush and ex who happens to be Rebecca's twin.  Will Rebecca be able to survive being trapped in the dollhouse for 24 hours or will Daniel and Matt save the day?  Do you think we can trust Rebecca or Maddie? Someone is sus.

Attira altre nazioni nella tua orbita attraverso abilit\u00e0 diplomatiche, leva economica o corruzione diretta. Costruisci una duratura fazione internazionale di governi affini, perseguendo obiettivi comuni per il bene comune e la gloria del tuo potere.\n\nLa simulazione di grande strategia dell'Et\u00e0 Vittoriana di Paradox Interactive offre nuovi modi per imporre la tua volont\u00e0 sul mondo. Una coalizione di potenze reazionarie pu\u00f2 formare blocchi per lavorare contro la minaccia delle forze liberali in altre nazioni. Usa la tua potenza economica per cooptare o costringere altri regimi, diffondendo il vessillo della tua ideologia ovunque le tue flotte possano navigare. Resisti o abbraccia la pressione interna per cambiare la tua politica estera tradizionale, mentre agitatori economici e ideologici ti spingono a costruire nuove coalizioni di potere.\n\nSphere of Influence aggiunge molte nuove azioni e sistemi per illustrare la natura rapida delle relazioni diplomatiche in questa epoca drammatica, includendo nuovi contenuti specificamente incentrati sul Grande Gioco - la competizione decennale tra gli imperi britannico e russo per la preminenza nel Nord India e nell'Asia Centrale.\n\nLe caratteristiche di Victoria 3: Sphere of Influence includono:\n\nCompetizione Feroce: Usa il tuo Prestigio per diventare una Grande Potenza e creare il tuo Blocco di Potere! Domina altre nazioni in un accordo diplomatico per perseguire obiettivi economici o ideologici comuni, sia promuovendo il commercio aperto nel mondo sia diffondendo valori specifici in altre nazioni.\n\nPersonalizzazione del Blocco di Potere: Scegli l'identit\u00e0 e i principi della tua alleanza, che sia un gruppo che promuove preoccupazioni ideologiche come il Comintern, o un blocco orientato all'economia che spinge per l'integrazione del mercato transfrontaliero come lo Zollverein. Puoi persino personalizzare colori ed emblemi per il tuo blocco!\n\n\"Il Grande Gioco\": Nuovi eventi, voci di diario e decisioni ispirate alla rivalit\u00e0 tra Russia e Gran Bretagna in Asia Centrale, e un nuovo Obiettivo - puoi giocare come una delle potenze centrali a quel conflitto, inclusi Persia e Afghanistan. Una mappa ridisegnata mette in evidenza i molti interessi concorrenti in questa frontiera tra imperi.\n\nInvestimenti Esteri: Investi nello sviluppo economico di paesi al di fuori della tua influenza diretta, traendo profitto dal loro successo finanziario.\n\nNazionalizzazione: Avvia una Mossa Diplomatica per sequestrare beni stranieri nel tuo paese e impedire che la tua ricchezza vada all'estero.\n\nInterazioni con i Soggetti: Regola i pagamenti dai tuoi vassalli e protettorati, intromettiti nella loro politica interna e altro ancora!\n\nLobby dei Gruppi di Interesse: I gruppi di interesse domestici perseguiranno obiettivi di politica estera, promuovendo relazioni amichevoli con alcuni paesi e ostilit\u00e0 con altri, o addirittura influenzando lo sviluppo di lobby amichevoli in altre nazioni.\n\nMonumenti del Blocco di Potere: Costruisci monumenti maestosi per enfatizzare l'influenza e la dominazione del tuo blocco sugli eventi mondiali.\n\nNuovo Sapore Storico: Nuovi personaggi e compagnie storiche, per lo pi\u00f9 incentrati sui contenuti del Grande Gioco, cos\u00ec come pi\u00f9 eventi, nuove voci di diario, contenuti legati alle lobby, nuovi abiti e arte degli eventi.",

Attira altre nazioni nella tua orbita attraverso abilit\u00e0 diplomatiche, leva economica o corruzione diretta. Costruisci una duratura fazione internazionale di governi affini, perseguendo obiettivi comuni per il bene comune e la gloria del tuo potere.\n\nLa simulazione di grande strategia dell'Et\u00e0 Vittoriana di Paradox Interactive offre nuovi modi per imporre la tua volont\u00e0 sul mondo. Una coalizione di potenze reazionarie pu\u00f2 formare blocchi per lavorare contro la minaccia delle forze liberali in altre nazioni. Usa la tua potenza economica per cooptare o costringere altri regimi, diffondendo il vessillo della tua ideologia ovunque le tue flotte possano navigare. Resisti o abbraccia la pressione interna per cambiare la tua politica estera tradizionale, mentre agitatori economici e ideologici ti spingono a costruire nuove coalizioni di potere.\n\nSphere of Influence aggiunge molte nuove azioni e sistemi per illustrare la natura rapida delle relazioni diplomatiche in questa epoca drammatica, includendo nuovi contenuti specificamente incentrati sul Grande Gioco - la competizione decennale tra gli imperi britannico e russo per la preminenza nel Nord India e nell'Asia Centrale.\n\nLe caratteristiche di Victoria 3: Sphere of Influence includono:\n\nCompetizione Feroce: Usa il tuo Prestigio per diventare una Grande Potenza e creare il tuo Blocco di Potere! Domina altre nazioni in un accordo diplomatico per perseguire obiettivi economici o ideologici comuni, sia promuovendo il commercio aperto nel mondo sia diffondendo valori specifici in altre nazioni.\n\nPersonalizzazione del Blocco di Potere: Scegli l'identit\u00e0 e i principi della tua alleanza, che sia un gruppo che promuove preoccupazioni ideologiche come il Comintern, o un blocco orientato all'economia che spinge per l'integrazione del mercato transfrontaliero come lo Zollverein. Puoi persino personalizzare colori ed emblemi per il tuo blocco!\n\n\"Il Grande Gioco\": Nuovi eventi, voci di diario e decisioni ispirate alla rivalit\u00e0 tra Russia e Gran Bretagna in Asia Centrale, e un nuovo Obiettivo - puoi giocare come una delle potenze centrali a quel conflitto, inclusi Persia e Afghanistan. Una mappa ridisegnata mette in evidenza i molti interessi concorrenti in questa frontiera tra imperi.\n\nInvestimenti Esteri: Investi nello sviluppo economico di paesi al di fuori della tua influenza diretta, traendo profitto dal loro successo finanziario.\n\nNazionalizzazione: Avvia una Mossa Diplomatica per sequestrare beni stranieri nel tuo paese e impedire che la tua ricchezza vada all'estero.\n\nInterazioni con i Soggetti: Regola i pagamenti dai tuoi vassalli e protettorati, intromettiti nella loro politica interna e altro ancora!\n\nLobby dei Gruppi di Interesse: I gruppi di interesse domestici perseguiranno obiettivi di politica estera, promuovendo relazioni amichevoli con alcuni paesi e ostilit\u00e0 con altri, o addirittura influenzando lo sviluppo di lobby amichevoli in altre nazioni.\n\nMonumenti del Blocco di Potere: Costruisci monumenti maestosi per enfatizzare l'influenza e la dominazione del tuo blocco sugli eventi mondiali.\n\nNuovo Sapore Storico: Nuovi personaggi e compagnie storiche, per lo pi\u00f9 incentrati sui contenuti del Grande Gioco, cos\u00ec come pi\u00f9 eventi, nuove voci di diario, contenuti legati alle lobby, nuovi abiti e arte degli eventi."

Prussia has never been easier than now with the changes to relations with Austria and Russia in the 1.7.3 (and 1.7.4) patch. I made this guide on 1.7.3, but the strategy is basically the same as 1.7.4 so it's no big deal.\n\nIn this guide, you'll learn how to unite Germany as soon as possible, and how to do it while ensuring Austria supports you. It's a surprisingly low RNG method, which means it'll be consistent for even relatively inexperienced players.\n\nThe potential for immense GDP and Standard of Living as Super Germany even without a ton of conquest is huge, but to be clear, if you want to hit the truly insane numbers, more conquest would of course be better.\n\nAmish Paradise Guide: https://youtu.be/uC2xz9qwyCo\n\nI hope you enjoy this video, and if you do, leave a like and subscribe to see more.

Why do I resaw lumber in a weird way? Why don\u2019t I do it like 99% of other woodworkers? This video answers these questions and more.\n\nIf you don\u2019t know what resawing is, it\u2019s standing a board on edge and cutting down its length. Probably the two most common reasons woodworkers do this is to make matched boards, meaning, cut a board in half and splay it out so the grain mirrors on each side. The other reason is simply making your own thin boards or veneer.\n\nGet extra perks and help to support this channel by joining the Superhero Community:  https://www.patreon.com/newtonmakes\n\nUnless I\u2019m resawing a really small piece or have a special project need, I\u2019ll almost always use the table saw first to resaw my lumber, not the bandsaw. I place a jig over my table saw fence. This gives me a tall surface area so my workpiece is stable. I set the thickness of my workpieces by measuring from the blade to the fence. A table saw blade is ridged so I don\u2019t have to worry about blade drift. Next, I set the blade height to just under half of the width of the board. I place the board against the fence and clamp a feather board in place so it keeps my workpiece secure and tight to the fence. Then, I make a cut. I push the board all the way through the blade and turn off the saw. After the one side is cut, I flip the board over and cut the other side. In total, it takes literally seconds to cut both sides. Afterwards, I go the bandsaw and quickly buzz the tiny piece left over in the middle. I can resaw a board completely using the table saw, but I find it safer to use the bandsaw to finish up that middle spot. \n\nHere are some pros and cons:\n\u2022 Speed: Resawing at the bandsaw is slow and I make a lot of curved cuts. That means I\u2019m spending longer resawing boards, and then even longer by changing to thinner blades for cutting curves in boards.\n\u2022 Accuracy: For me, there\u2019s bound to be blade drift when I resaw on a band saw. The cut isn\u2019t exactly the thickness I want. \n\u2022 Cleanup: Bandsaw blades do not leave the cleanest cuts and leaves many more saw marks that I have to plane or sand away. The table saw leaves me which a tiny sliver in the middle, which is no big deal.\n\u2022 Safety: The band saw is much safer for resawing. Again, THE BAND SAW IS MUCH SAFER FOR RESAWING! Use the method most comfortable for you. \n\u2022 Dust collection: Bandsaw dust collection is awful. \n\u2022 Material waste: The band saw usually does not waste as much wood. However, I often use a circular saw blade in the table saw, which is thinner. Add in blade drift and clean up work and the waste difference isn\u2019t a huge amount.\n\nYEP!

This video shows how to make a tenon jig that will blow open your possibilities for making insanely cool woodworking joinery. Plus BONUS info on making a castle joint! \n\nIt's difficult to beat the joinery strength of a tenon. Accurate tenon joints are rock solid and not difficult to make. I decided to tackle the castle joint with the use of this woodworking tenoning jig. This joinery method can look really difficult. All of the boards have to align perfectly. When they do, your woodworking project looks otherworldly! Here\u2019s the thing\u2026this isn\u2019t a difficult woodworking joint to make. It actually pretty simple and just takes a little bit of planning. Another massive positive for using this joinery technique is it requires no real measuring. You\u2019ll notice in the video that I don\u2019t take any measurements. I simply reference lumber off of each other. Eliminating the math helps to eliminate the errors.\n\nIf you want to try making a castle joint and a bunch of other cool woodworking joint, make this tenon jig.
