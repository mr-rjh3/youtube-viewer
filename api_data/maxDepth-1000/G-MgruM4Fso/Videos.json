Tap here to download: https://woo.ga/sj4axj1d Play on Android, iOS, and PC through Facebook Games.\n\nHere, we take our cool Palmako kit-set cabin that we constructed in last weeks episode (view here: https://youtu.be/LzmHQuFsG_Q) and take the cabin build to the next level, creating decks and awnings which really help to connect the cabin to the outdoors and doing a full cabinetry fit-out on the interior.\n\nThe front deck will be such a nice place to sit and enjoy all day sun, as well as a great place to BBQ and entertain.

Discover June\u2019s Journey for FREE! Tap here to download: https://woo.ga/sj4axj1d Play on Android, iOS, and PC through Facebook Games.\n\nHere, we take our cool Palmako kit-set cabin that we constructed in last weeks episode (view here: https://youtu.be/LzmHQuFsG_Q) and take the cabin build to the next level, creating decks and awnings which really help to connect the cabin to the outdoors and doing a full cabinetry fit-out on the interior.\n\nThe front deck will be such a nice place to sit and enjoy all day sun, as well as a great place to BBQ and entertain. The interior fit-out will provide a huge amount of function and storage as we add a kitchenette, shelving, build-in-wardrobes and more.

Now, their tiny home is parked on their own land, where they're renovating the main house to rent, creating lush outdoor living space, and building a shed conversion man-cave.\n\n\ud83c\udfe1\ud83d\udee0\ufe0f\ud83d\udc49 Check out Tiffany's YT channel, @beautyandabuilder \n\ud83d\udc49 Follow her: instagram.com/beautyandabuilder & tiktok.com/@beautyandabuilder\n\n\ud83d\udc49CONNECT with tiny nerds, Alexis & Christian:\nhttps://www.tiktok.com/@tiny_house_expedition \nhttps://instagram.com/tiny_house_expedition\nhttps://facebook.com/TinyHouseExpedition\n\nPlease SUBSCRIBE for more tiny houses, DIY, design, community, simple living & alternative lifestyle, and documentaries. \ud83c\udfe1\u2728\u2764\ufe0f\n\n\ud83e\udd1d Brand Deals: tinyhouseexpedition@thestation.io\n\n\u2728Check out our website for tiny house resources: https://tinyhouseexpedition.com \ud83d\udc40\n\nCREDITS:\n\u2747\ufe0f produced by Tiny House Expedition's Christian & Alexis\n\u2747\ufe0f shot by Blake Hemmel, https://www.youtube.com/c/BlakeHemmel\n\u2747\ufe0f edited by Payton Wagner, https://vimeo.com/paytonwagner\n\u2747\ufe0f  additional photos provided by @beautyandabuilder \n\nVideo Chapters:\n0:00 - DIY tiny house on own land\n1:30 - interior tiny house tour\n3:23 - custom closet system\n6:12 - sponsor message\n7:15 - living room\n8:59 - tiny kitchen\n12:30 - family story\n14:02 - DIY American dream \n14:52 - tiny bathroom\n17:08 - loft bedroom & gaming setup\n19:05 - her build journey\n20:45 - tiny house cost & financing\n22:28 - her advice\n22:58 - more tiny homes!\n\n#tinyhouse #tinyhousebuild #tinyhousemovement #jackery #jackery1000 \u00a0#solargenerator \u00a0#jackery1000v2 #whatcanjackerypower"

Designed with women in mind, this home is vibrant, functional, and cozy, showcasing how tiny living can be both spacious and welcoming. If you're a woman considering tiny living, this tour is for you!\n\nVibrant Living Room for Connection and Community\nWhen stepping into Stacey's living room, the first thing you'll notice is the vibrant art that brings the space to life. She designed this room to be a TV-free zone focused on connection and community. The seating area is perfect for putting on shoes or leaning against the credenza. This space is all about creating a welcoming atmosphere for friends and family.\n\nHeart of the Home: The Kitchen\nThe kitchen is the heart of Stacey's tiny home, and it was essential to her to have a functional and beautiful space. She worked with her builder to create more counter space by relocating the refrigerator and adding open shelves. The kitchen features a gas cooktop, a deep sink, and a Panasonic 4-in-1 appliance that bakes, air fries, saut\u00e9s, and pressure cooks. The kitchen is designed for both cooking and socializing, making it perfect for hosting.\n\nCozy and Functional Bathroom\nThough it's the smallest room in the house, Stacey's bathroom packs a mighty punch. It features wallpaper for a pop of color and a rain shower for a luxurious feel. She also included a crystal and plants to enhance the energy of the space. The quartz countertop and gold accents make the bathroom feel like a spa.\n\nPractical Laundry and Storage Solutions\nIn the hallway, Stacey opted for a washer and dryer instead of a linen closet, making it a practical choice for tiny living. The broom closet and pantry provide additional storage space. This setup ensures that every inch of space is used efficiently.\n\nMeditation and Zen Space\nStacey's loft serves as a meditation room and office, divided by a bookshelf with plants. The serene environment is perfect for starting the day with meditation and capturing inspiration for her coaching and business. The space also includes a TV area with a pop of blue for relaxation.\n\nMystic Design Bedroom\nThe bedroom is Stacey's sanctuary with a Mystic design, featuring artwork that brings the space to life. The dresser bay and three shades of pink make the room feel larger and more inviting. The closet offers ample storage, and the step stool helps her reach everything. The double bed provides walking space and complements the aesthetic of the room.\n\nEmpowerment and Connection\nStacey believes in using her home as a 3D vision board to manifest love, health, and wealth. The Mystic design elements throughout the Tiny Vixen reflect this philosophy. She encourages viewers to explore their own Mystic design with the free Bedroom Empowerment gift linked in the description.\n\nJoin the Tiny Living Movement\nTiny living is becoming an essential solution to housing affordability. Stacey's journey from New York to Orlando and finally to California has shown her the transformative power of tiny living. She's passionate about advocating for this lifestyle and helping others find security and joy in tiny spaces.\n\nConnect with Stacy\nIf you have questions about tiny living, design tips, or her cross-country journey, feel free to reach out to her at mysticddesignbystacey@gmail.com or visit her website at mysticddesignbystacey.com.

Their direct support helps keep this channel afloat in the ever unstable world of YouTube ad revenue. These videos will always be disclosed, of course, and I appreciate everyone's kind support for these partnerships. Royalty Soaps also participates in commission or discount affiliations, like Amazon or RewardStyle, as these opportunities become available, like Amazon and RewardStyle and while the money we make with these links isn't much, every little bit counts and once again, we really appreciate your support! These products will always be marked and disclosed with a \"\u2726\".",

Their direct support helps keep this channel afloat in the ever unstable world of YouTube ad revenue. These videos will always be disclosed, of course, and I appreciate everyone's kind support for these partnerships. Royalty Soaps also participates in commission or discount affiliations, like Amazon or RewardStyle, as these opportunities become available, like Amazon and RewardStyle and while the money we make with these links isn't much, every little bit counts and once again, we really appreciate your support!

Their direct support helps keep this channel afloat in the ever unstable world of YouTube ad revenue. These videos will always be disclosed, of course, and I appreciate everyone's kind support for these partnerships. Royalty Soaps also participates in commission or discount affiliations, like Amazon or RewardStyle, as these opportunities become available, like Amazon and RewardStyle and while the money we make with these links isn't much, every little bit counts and once again, we really appreciate your support!

                    "description": "Formulating your own cold process soap recipes is easy! In this video, Bramble Berry CEO and Founder, Anne-Marie Faiola, goes over the basics of formulating cold process soap recipes. \n\nTo create your own recipe, start by choosing your base oils. You can use each one around 20-30%. For the remaining portion, consider what you\u2019d like the bar to feel like. Do you want it to be super moisturizing, have a nice thick lather, or to be hard and long lasting? How you want your soap to feel and look will guide you in choosing your oils.\n\nYou can never go wrong with a 34/33/33 ratio. That\u2019s 34% olive oil, 33% coconut oil, and 33% palm oil. They\u2019re commonly used because they complement each other well. Palm oil acts as a secondary lathering agent and hardens the soap, coconut oil is cleansing and produces big bubbles, and olive oil is moisturizing and gives bars a silky feeling. \n\nLooking for more information on how to formulate cold process soap recipes?

                        "description": "Formulating your own cold process soap recipes is easy! In this video, Bramble Berry CEO and Founder, Anne-Marie Faiola, goes over the basics of formulating cold process soap recipes. \n\nTo create your own recipe, start by choosing your base oils. You can use each one around 20-30%. For the remaining portion, consider what you\u2019d like the bar to feel like. Do you want it to be super moisturizing, have a nice thick lather, or to be hard and long lasting? How you want your soap to feel and look will guide you in choosing your oils.\n\nYou can never go wrong with a 34/33/33 ratio. That\u2019s 34% olive oil, 33% coconut oil, and 33% palm oil. They\u2019re commonly used because they complement each other well. Palm oil acts as a secondary lathering agent and hardens the soap, coconut oil is cleansing and produces big bubbles, and olive oil is moisturizing and gives bars a silky feeling. \n\nLooking for more information on how to formulate cold process soap recipes?

                    "description": "This cold process recipe is designed for beginners. It has simple ingredients that are easy to work with. It's the perfect recipe to try cold process soap for the first time! \n\n\ud83d\udcae Simple and Gentle Soap Project: https://bberry.studio/SimpleGentleSoap\n\nThis recipe is made with coconut oil, palm oil, and olive oil. They\u2019re commonly used because they complement each other well. Palm oil acts as a secondary lathering agent and hardens the soap, coconut oil is cleansing and produces big bubbles, and olive oil is moisturizing and gives the bars a silky feeling. \n\n\ud83d\udcae Coconut Oil: https://bberry.studio/CoconutOil\n\nThe soap is unscented and uncolored to keep things easy. Once you have a few batches under your belt, you can start experimenting with additives. For the mold, you can use almost any box or container that you have on hand. You'll just need to line it with freezer paper so the soap doesn't stick.\n\n\ud83d\udcae Simple and Gentle Soap recipe:\n8 oz. Coconut Oil (24%)\n15 oz. Olive Oil (44%)\n11 oz. Palm Oil (32%)\n4.8 oz. Lye\n11.2 oz. Distilled Water\n\n\ud83d\udcae Key Terms:\n\u2022 Saponification: The chemical reaction that occurs when oil and lye molecules create new soap molecules.\n\u2022 Trace: The point when oils and lye water emulsify and begin to thicken. Once the soap has reached thin trace, it will continue to thicken as it sits. \n\u2022 Emulsify: When the oils and lye solution mix and don't separate. The term emulsify and trace are often used interchangeably.\n\u2022 Superfat: Any extra oil that's not turned into soap. \n\u2022 Gel phase: \"Gelling\" or \"gel phase\" refers to when the soap gets warm and gelatinous \u2013 up to 180\u00b0 F. Gel phase results in brighter colors and a shinier, more translucent appearance. \n\u2022 Soda ash: When unsaponified lye reacts with naturally-occurring carbon dioxide in the air and creates a white ashy film on the bars. It only affects the way the soap looks, not the quality.\n\nMade this project?

The term emulsify and trace are often used interchangeably.\n\u2022 Superfat: Any extra oil that's not turned into soap. \n\u2022 Gel phase: \"Gelling\" or \"gel phase\" refers to when the soap gets warm and gelatinous \u2013 up to 180\u00b0 F. Gel phase results in brighter colors and a shinier, more translucent appearance. \n\u2022 Soda ash: When unsaponified lye reacts with naturally-occurring carbon dioxide in the air and creates a white ashy film on the bars. It only affects the way the soap looks, not the quality.\n\nMade this project?

                    "description": "#glycerinesoap #soapmaking #handmade #handmadesoap -  For crying out loud! This is DEFINITELY the updated and correct version of this transparent soap recipe and method, after uploading the wrong edit not once, but TWICE! \n\nNever have to buy pricey Stephensons transparent melt & pour base ever again by making your very own transparent soap base at home.  This is a reboot of an earlier video. How to make transparent soap appears to be a popular search, so it seems weird that my earlier video was low on views (YT algorithms?). So, I thought I'd reboot it and give it another go in the hope it reaches more people who, like me, have struggled to find a user-friendly transparent soap recipe to make at home. When I was exploring making my own transparent soap from scratch, most of the videos I could find seemed a bit too scientific, overly complicated, involved a microwave and less accessible ingredients, moreover, they were mostly from countries which weren't English speaking and therefore the only details were from sketchy auto translations! A bit more research led me to a couple of transparent soap recipes, using hot process soap making methods in a crockpot, and to me, these seemed far easier for homemade soap making. However, all the crockpot recipes stemmed from the United States, were in imperial measures and used American brand name products, like Everclear, that we don't have in the UK. Soooo, I endeavoured to formulate my own transparent soap recipe, in grams, using more generic ingredients that, hopefully, can be found and purchased the world over.",

                        "description": "#glycerinesoap #soapmaking #handmade #handmadesoap -  For crying out loud! This is DEFINITELY the updated and correct version of this transparent soap recipe and method, after uploading the wrong edit not once, but TWICE! \n\nNever have to buy pricey Stephensons transparent melt & pour base ever again by making your very own transparent soap base at home.  This is a reboot of an earlier video. How to make transparent soap appears to be a popular search, so it seems weird that my earlier video was low on views (YT algorithms?). So, I thought I'd reboot it and give it another go in the hope it reaches more people who, like me, have struggled to find a user-friendly transparent soap recipe to make at home. When I was exploring making my own transparent soap from scratch, most of the videos I could find seemed a bit too scientific, overly complicated, involved a microwave and less accessible ingredients, moreover, they were mostly from countries which weren't English speaking and therefore the only details were from sketchy auto translations! A bit more research led me to a couple of transparent soap recipes, using hot process soap making methods in a crockpot, and to me, these seemed far easier for homemade soap making. However, all the crockpot recipes stemmed from the United States, were in imperial measures and used American brand name products, like Everclear, that we don't have in the UK. Soooo, I endeavoured to formulate my own transparent soap recipe, in grams, using more generic ingredients that, hopefully, can be found and purchased the world over."

                    "description": "This is a simple recipe for 100% coconut oil soap that can be used for bathing. Coconut oil soap is well known for its great lather and strong cleaning power, but it can be drying to the skin, so this recipe uses a high 25% superfat to make the soap more gentle and suitable for bathing and hand washing. \n\nAll the recipe details are below, including a half size and low superfat version of the recipe for cleaning. \n\n*Recipe details*\nThe Video Recipe - 25% superfat - large batch\n840g coconut oil\n234g water (any drinking water is fine)\nThis recipe uses a 2:1 water to lye ratio (33% lye concentration) for the water-lye solution. \n115g sodium hydroxide / NaOH\n\nThis recipe makes just under 1200g of soap (12 x 100g bars)\nYou will need a mould that holds at least 1.2 litres or 40.5 fluid ounces of liquid to make this recipe.\n\nHalf Sized Recipe - 25% superfat\n420g coconut oil\n117g water\n57g sodium hydroxide / NaOH\n\nLower superfat recipe for cleaning soap (will be drying on skin)\n840g coconut oil\n292g water\n146g sodium hydroxide (5% superfat)\n\nMETHOD as per video\nIf you make the low superfat version for a cleaning soap, be prepared for it to saponify faster and go through a more vigorous and hotter 'gel phase', particularly if made in a loaf mould. Do not insulate this soap after it's poured, just leave it uncovered (it will get hot!).  \n\n*New to soap making? This is important!*\nSodium hydroxide and potassium hydroxide (lyes) used in soap making, in granular or flake form or in solution with water/other liquids, as well as raw soap batter, are highly corrosive and require careful and attentive handling and the proper use of personal protective equipment.

I am not qualified in chemistry or skincare formulation, I am completely self-taught! But these methods have served me (and many of you) very well over the years. This video shows how I do the manual calculations for citric acid in soap making, and brings together all the basics I've talked about on this channel over the years.\n\nKeep your eye out for Part 2 of this series where I demonstrate making the 'Flower Soap' that I formulated in this video.

The information given is based on what works for me, however, there are lots of variables associated with cold process soap making and I, therefore, take no responsibility for the results achieved when using the techniques or methods explained in these tutorials. Cold process soap involves the necessary use of sodium Hydroxide (lye) which is a very dangerous substance. Before attempting and cold process soap making you should ensure you are fully aware of the lye safety procedures and always wear the correct safety equipment when making soap.\n#soapmaking  #coldprocessoap",

The information given is based on what works for me, however, there are lots of variables associated with cold process soap making and I, therefore, take no responsibility for the results achieved when using the techniques or methods explained in these tutorials. Cold process soap involves the necessary use of sodium Hydroxide (lye) which is a very dangerous substance. Before attempting and cold process soap making you should ensure you are fully aware of the lye safety procedures and always wear the correct safety equipment when making soap.\n#soapmaking  #coldprocessoap"

I believe you can make your home beautiful on a thrifty budget! I will take you on so many thrift with me shopping trips, share my thrift hauls and almost always show you how to use thrift finds in your home. I post every Friday and sometimes on Tuesday.
