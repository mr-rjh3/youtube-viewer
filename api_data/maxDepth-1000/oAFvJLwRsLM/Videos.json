So also babies can quiet down before going to bed, and the best for this purpose are relaxing lullabies and calm, soothing music such as this 12 hour sleep music for babies which is slow and has soft music box sounds and in the background you can hear the sounds of the forest.\nIn this video, we move into an enchanted mushroom forest and walk through it in the moonlight admiring these magical glowing mushrooms.\nSo if you don't know how to sleep for 12 hours try playing this video with this gentle lullaby and see if it helps you or your baby - let us know with a thumbs up if it helps. \nThank you!\n\nGreg S.\n\nSubscribe to this channel \u25ba  https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCH-GlQNRjjdizKr57o-7oaA?sub_confirmation=1\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nOur the best sleep music for babies ever (it works for many babies): \nhttps://youtu.be/zKnZuFF_cdw \nhttps://youtu.be/CBoBxMrM2gQ\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------\nI am a composer and producer. \nAll songs on this channel are mine or my team's.\nI have all rights to them myself.\nPlease contact me first before you want to copy them.\nI do all the videos with my team for you and your little ones for your calming down and your peaceful sleep.\nGreg S.\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nMusic: \" Mushroom Forest \" - looped 12 hour sleep music by Greg S\nAnimation and Production: AVM, Relaxing Lullabies by Greg S.\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------\n#12_hour_sleep_music_for_babies #lullaby_for_babies_to_go_to_sleep #sleep_music #mushroomForest #12_hour_of_sleep_music #lullaby_12Hours \n\n\n\u00a9 2022 Relaxing Lullabies by Greg S.\nAll rights reserved.

Here are some reasons why you should consider incorporating these soothing tunes into your little one\u2019s routine:\n\nCalms Babies and Promotes Sleep: Lullabies have a magical effect on infants. The gentle melodies and repetitive lyrics help calm crying babies, making it easier for them to drift off to sleep. A well-rested baby tends to be happier, more active, and engaged in activities.\n\nStimulates Language Development: Exposing your baby to different melodies and lyrics from lullabies can enhance language skills. Early exposure to music helps babies recognize sounds, learn new vocabulary, and develop strong language and literacy abilities.\n\nStrengthens Parent-Child Bond: Singing lullabies creates a special bonding experience between you and your baby. The soothing tones and one-on-one communication foster emotional connections.\n\nImproves Motor Skills and Memory: Babies learn to differentiate between sounds and melodies through lullabies. Singing helps them manipulate objects and enhances their motor skills and memory.\n\nBoosts Creativity and Expression: Lullabies introduce babies to the world of music and creativity. Familiar tunes encourage self-expression and creativity from an early age.\n\nSo go ahead, hum those sweet lullabies\u2014it\u2019s not just about putting your baby to sleep; it\u2019s about nurturing their development and creating beautiful memories together! \ud83c\udf19\ud83c\udfb6\n\n#babylullaby #babymusic #babyvideos",

                    "description": "Hey Bear Sensory - Fruit Salad Dance Party - Counting 1 to 10 - Fun Animation with Music\n\nHey Bear Sensory official plush available!\nhttps://heybearsensory.store/collections/plush\n\n\nWelcome to Hey Bear Sensory! \n\nThis video is not a traditional counting tool, and you won't see any numbers. But we encourage you to use the the scenes within to encourage and introduce counting, for example, there's five blueberries and they all jump five times. Maybe get some blueberries out of the fridge and count with them as well ( and eat them!). The thought process behind this was that most 'learning' or counting tools are focused on remembering the numerical symbol, for example seeing numbers lined up 1-10.

But we encourage you to use the the scenes within to encourage and introduce counting, for example, there's five blueberries and they all jump five times. Maybe get some blueberries out of the fridge and count with them as well ( and eat them!). The thought process behind this was that most 'learning' or counting tools are focused on remembering the numerical symbol, for example seeing numbers lined up 1-10. You can count the movements, the characters or both. Theres plenty of opportunity to learn, or just enjoy your favourite characters! \nAll of our \ufffcanimations are presented to you in beautiful 4K at 60 frames per second.

                    "description": "Have your baby practice milestones with a real teacher, Ms Rachel! Ms Rachel uses baby songs, nursery rhymes and play to show how to encourage speech and language development, cognitive skills and social emotional growth. \n\nTake Ms Rachel\u2019s Baby Test and see how many gestures your baby can do! Try to get 16 gestures by 16 months old. Ms Rachel will show and encourage 18 gestures in the first 10 minutes of this video that you can work on with your child. Then she will model speech development from infants to 15 months old. She will also model pretend play which is an 18 month old milestone. Throughout the whole video, other key milestones are taught through fun kids songs, rhymes and play! Ms Rachel will also show sign language and first words. While babies watch, parents can learn more about their baby\u2019s development and how to support them during this important time! \n\nAlso we have a very special guest this episode from the Today Show! Gadi Schwartz guest stars in this episode and sings, dances and even teaches us how to count in Spanish! \n\nIf you child isn\u2019t meeting their milestones, you should tell your pediatrician and call your state\u2019s early intervention program. Your child may qualify for free therapies such as speech therapy, occupational therapy, physical therapy or more. It\u2019s best to get your child help as young as possible. \n\nRemember that the best thing for your baby or toddler is you! Interact with your baby, respond to their cues, play on the floor with them, read to them, sing to them, narrate your day for them and show them love and care! Thanks for watching Songs for Littles \n\n#msrachel #babysongs #babyvideos #babylearning #learntotalk #babylearningvideos #toddlervideos #firstwords \n\nWe hope you enjoy this baby learning video. Check out Ms Rachel\u2019s other baby learning videos and toddler learning videos on her page.

                        "description": "Have your baby practice milestones with a real teacher, Ms Rachel! Ms Rachel uses baby songs, nursery rhymes and play to show how to encourage speech and language development, cognitive skills and social emotional growth. \n\nTake Ms Rachel\u2019s Baby Test and see how many gestures your baby can do! Try to get 16 gestures by 16 months old. Ms Rachel will show and encourage 18 gestures in the first 10 minutes of this video that you can work on with your child. Then she will model speech development from infants to 15 months old. She will also model pretend play which is an 18 month old milestone. Throughout the whole video, other key milestones are taught through fun kids songs, rhymes and play! Ms Rachel will also show sign language and first words. While babies watch, parents can learn more about their baby\u2019s development and how to support them during this important time! \n\nAlso we have a very special guest this episode from the Today Show! Gadi Schwartz guest stars in this episode and sings, dances and even teaches us how to count in Spanish! \n\nIf you child isn\u2019t meeting their milestones, you should tell your pediatrician and call your state\u2019s early intervention program. Your child may qualify for free therapies such as speech therapy, occupational therapy, physical therapy or more. It\u2019s best to get your child help as young as possible. \n\nRemember that the best thing for your baby or toddler is you! Interact with your baby, respond to their cues, play on the floor with them, read to them, sing to them, narrate your day for them and show them love and care! Thanks for watching Songs for Littles \n\n#msrachel #babysongs #babyvideos #babylearning #learntotalk #babylearningvideos #toddlervideos #firstwords \n\nWe hope you enjoy this baby learning video. Check out Ms Rachel\u2019s other baby learning videos and toddler learning videos on her page. If you are looking for the best videos for babies and the best videos for toddlers, you will find them with Ms Rachel."

Lullabies are often soothing and relaxing, with a slow tempo, low volume, and soft instruments. Lullabies can have different purposes in different cultures, such as passing down knowledge, tradition, or language. Lullabies can also have benefits for children's health and development, such as reducing stress and anxiety, improving sleep quality and duration, and enhancing brain development and learning.\n____________________________________\n#lullaby #sleepmusic #babysleep\n____________________________________\n\ud83c\udf08 Please Like, Share, Comment, and Subscribe to share your comments and support our channel: https://www.youtube.com/@lullabylandkids2\n\n\ud83c\udf08 Listen to more lullabies for kids: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLU5G8HFU-DlySfaAc5wmMQKJaDZJSRoUX\n\n____________________________________\n\u25ba About us:\n\u25ba Website: https://woanetwork.com\n\u25ba General inquiry: info@woanetwork.com\n\u25ba Business partnership: business@woanetwork.com\n\u25ba SCONNECT website: https://s-connect.net\n\n\u00a9 Copyright by Woa Music \u261e Do not Reup",

Peppa\u2019s favourite things include playing games and music, learning animal sounds, dressing up, days out, shopping, holidays and jumping in muddy puddles. Her adventures always end happily with loud snorts of laughter.\n\nPeppa likes playing with her best friend Suzy Sheep, visiting Granny and Grandpa Pig and looking after George. Most of all, Peppa loves jumping up and down in muddy puddles, laughing and making loud snorting noises. \n\nGeorge Pig is Peppa\u2019s little brother. He is 18 months old and loves to play with his big sister, Peppa \u2013 even when she\u2019s being bossy. George\u2019s favourite thing is his toy dinosaur. He carries it everywhere with him. George can\u2019t speak yet but can say one word very well: \u2018Dine-saw!\u2019 \n\nMummy Pig likes jumping up and down in muddy puddles almost as much as Peppa. She works from home on her computer and sometimes lets Peppa and George help, as long as they don\u2019t bash the keyboard. She is better at map reading than Daddy Pig and is very wise about most things. \n\nDaddy Pig is very jolly and laughs all the time, especially when he plays with Peppa and George. \nDaddy Pig reads the paper and gets excited about trips in the car. He loves cookies and pumpkin pie and Peppa teases him about his big round tummy. Daddy Pig can be a tiny bit grumpy sometimes when he can\u2019t remember where he put his glasses. \n\nHave fun with Peppa Pig and her friends: \n\nSuzy Sheep, Rebecca Rabbit, Danny Dog, Candy Cat, Pedro Pony, Zoe Zebra, Emily Elephant, Freddy Fox, Kylie Kangaroo, Wendy Wolf, Gabriella Goat, Gerald Giraffe, Molly Mole, Belinda Bear, Delphine Donkey, Peggi and Pandora Panda, Mandy Mouse, Simon Squirrel! \n\n\u2013\u2013\u2013\n \n\ud83d\udc37 Official Peppa Pig Channels \ud83d\udc37\nPeppa Pig - Official Channel: http://bit.ly/2PSSvJu\nPeppa Pig Chinese: http://bit.ly/2O38XcX\nPeppa Pig Croatian: https://bit.ly/2Git19o\nPeppa Pig Czech: https://bit.ly/2HL7BC1\nPeppa Pig Danish: http://bit.ly/2JRno1q\nPeppa Pig Dutch: http://bit.ly/2pu2Bpe\nPeppa Pig Finnish: http://bit.ly/2HRfPbA\nPeppa Pig French: http://bit.ly/2Nv2nML\nPeppa Pig German: http://bit.ly/2QOIQow\nPeppa Pig Greek: http://bit.ly/2GmzVrN\nPeppa Pig Hindi: http://bit.ly/2OD2NgG\nPeppa Pig Hungarian: http://bit.ly/2Yx9jKq\nPeppa Pig Italian: http://bit.ly/2QOvYPm\nPeppa Pig Japanese: http://bit.ly/2OOzF64\nPeppa Pig Korean: http://bit.ly/2pps03f\nPeppa pig Norwegian: https://bit.ly/2SmQVCQ\nPeppa Pig Polish: http://bit.ly/2MT5qcr\nPeppa Pig Portuguese: http://bit.ly/2pt6CKn\nPeppa Pig Spanish: http://bit.ly/2QPJ8vG\n \n\ud83d\udfe5 Subscribe For All The Latest Official Peppa Pig Content: http://bit.ly/PeppaPigYT\n \nPEPPA PIG \u00a9 ASTLEY BAKER DAVIES LTD/ENTERTAINMENT ONE UK LTD 2003.

Her adventures always end happily with loud snorts of laughter.\n\nPeppa likes playing with her best friend Suzy Sheep, visiting Granny and Grandpa Pig and looking after George. Most of all, Peppa loves jumping up and down in muddy puddles, laughing and making loud snorting noises. \n\nGeorge Pig is Peppa\u2019s little brother.

Peppa\u2019s favourite things include playing games and music, learning animal sounds, dressing up, days out, shopping, holidays and jumping in muddy puddles. Her adventures always end happily with loud snorts of laughter.\n\nPeppa likes playing with her best friend Suzy Sheep, visiting Granny and Grandpa Pig and looking after George. Most of all, Peppa loves jumping up and down in muddy puddles, laughing and making loud snorting noises. \n\nGeorge Pig is Peppa\u2019s little brother. He is 18 months old and loves to play with his big sister, Peppa \u2013 even when she\u2019s being bossy. George\u2019s favourite thing is his toy dinosaur. He carries it everywhere with him. George can\u2019t speak yet but can say one word very well: \u2018Dine-saw!\u2019 \n\nMummy Pig likes jumping up and down in muddy puddles almost as much as Peppa. She works from home on her computer and sometimes lets Peppa and George help, as long as they don\u2019t bash the keyboard. She is better at map reading than Daddy Pig and is very wise about most things. \n\nDaddy Pig is very jolly and laughs all the time, especially when he plays with Peppa and George. \nDaddy Pig reads the paper and gets excited about trips in the car. He loves cookies and pumpkin pie and Peppa teases him about his big round tummy. Daddy Pig can be a tiny bit grumpy sometimes when he can\u2019t remember where he put his glasses. \n\nHave fun with Peppa Pig and her friends: \n\nSuzy Sheep, Rebecca Rabbit, Danny Dog, Candy Cat, Pedro Pony, Zoe Zebra, Emily Elephant, Freddy Fox, Kylie Kangaroo, Wendy Wolf, Gabriella Goat, Gerald Giraffe, Molly Mole, Belinda Bear, Delphine Donkey, Peggi and Pandora Panda, Mandy Mouse, Simon Squirrel! \n\n\u2013\u2013\u2013\n \n\ud83d\udc37 Official Peppa Pig Channels \ud83d\udc37\nPeppa Pig - Official Channel: http://bit.ly/2PSSvJu\nPeppa Pig Chinese: http://bit.ly/2O38XcX\nPeppa Pig Croatian: https://bit.ly/2Git19o\nPeppa Pig Czech: https://bit.ly/2HL7BC1\nPeppa Pig Danish: http://bit.ly/2JRno1q\nPeppa Pig Dutch: http://bit.ly/2pu2Bpe\nPeppa Pig Finnish: http://bit.ly/2HRfPbA\nPeppa Pig French: http://bit.ly/2Nv2nML\nPeppa Pig German: http://bit.ly/2QOIQow\nPeppa Pig Greek: http://bit.ly/2GmzVrN\nPeppa Pig Hindi: http://bit.ly/2OD2NgG\nPeppa Pig Hungarian: http://bit.ly/2Yx9jKq\nPeppa Pig Italian: http://bit.ly/2QOvYPm\nPeppa Pig Japanese: http://bit.ly/2OOzF64\nPeppa Pig Korean: http://bit.ly/2pps03f\nPeppa pig Norwegian: https://bit.ly/2SmQVCQ\nPeppa Pig Polish: http://bit.ly/2MT5qcr\nPeppa Pig Portuguese: http://bit.ly/2pt6CKn\nPeppa Pig Spanish: http://bit.ly/2QPJ8vG\n \n\ud83d\udfe5 Subscribe For All The Latest Official Peppa Pig Content: http://bit.ly/PeppaPigYT\n \nPEPPA PIG \u00a9 ASTLEY BAKER DAVIES LTD/ENTERTAINMENT ONE UK LTD 2003.

She is four years old and lives with Mummy Pig, Daddy Pig and her little brother George. Peppa likes playing with her best friend Suzy Sheep, visiting Granny and Grandpa Pig and looking after George. Most of all, Peppa loves jumping up and down in muddy puddles, laughing and making loud snorting noises. \nGeorge Pig is Peppa\u2019s little brother. He is 18 months old and loves to play with his big sister, Peppa \u2013 even when she\u2019s being bossy. George\u2019s favourite thing is his toy dinosaur. He carries it everywhere with him.

Peppa\u2019s favourite things include playing games and music, learning animal sounds, dressing up, days out, shopping, holidays and jumping in muddy puddles. Her adventures always end happily with loud snorts of laughter.\n\nPeppa likes playing with her best friend Suzy Sheep, visiting Granny and Grandpa Pig and looking after George. Most of all, Peppa loves jumping up and down in muddy puddles, laughing and making loud snorting noises. \n\nGeorge Pig is Peppa\u2019s little brother. He is 18 months old and loves to play with his big sister, Peppa \u2013 even when she\u2019s being bossy. George\u2019s favourite thing is his toy dinosaur. He carries it everywhere with him. George can\u2019t speak yet but can say one word very well: \u2018Dine-saw!\u2019 \n\nMummy Pig likes jumping up and down in muddy puddles almost as much as Peppa. She works from home on her computer and sometimes lets Peppa and George help, as long as they don\u2019t bash the keyboard. She is better at map reading than Daddy Pig and is very wise about most things. \n\nDaddy Pig is very jolly and laughs all the time, especially when he plays with Peppa and George. \nDaddy Pig reads the paper and gets excited about trips in the car. He loves cookies and pumpkin pie and Peppa teases him about his big round tummy. Daddy Pig can be a tiny bit grumpy sometimes when he can\u2019t remember where he put his glasses. \n\nHave fun with Peppa Pig and her friends: \n\nSuzy Sheep, Rebecca Rabbit, Danny Dog, Candy Cat, Pedro Pony, Zoe Zebra, Emily Elephant, Freddy Fox, Kylie Kangaroo, Wendy Wolf, Gabriella Goat, Gerald Giraffe, Molly Mole, Belinda Bear, Delphine Donkey, Peggi and Pandora Panda, Mandy Mouse, Simon Squirrel! \n\n\u2013\u2013\u2013\n \n\ud83d\udc37 Official Peppa Pig Channels \ud83d\udc37\nPeppa Pig - Official Channel: http://bit.ly/2PSSvJu\nPeppa Pig Chinese: http://bit.ly/2O38XcX\nPeppa Pig Croatian: https://bit.ly/2Git19o\nPeppa Pig Czech: https://bit.ly/2HL7BC1\nPeppa Pig Danish: http://bit.ly/2JRno1q\nPeppa Pig Dutch: http://bit.ly/2pu2Bpe\nPeppa Pig Finnish: http://bit.ly/2HRfPbA\nPeppa Pig French: http://bit.ly/2Nv2nML\nPeppa Pig German: http://bit.ly/2QOIQow\nPeppa Pig Greek: http://bit.ly/2GmzVrN\nPeppa Pig Hindi: http://bit.ly/2OD2NgG\nPeppa Pig Hungarian: http://bit.ly/2Yx9jKq\nPeppa Pig Italian: http://bit.ly/2QOvYPm\nPeppa Pig Japanese: http://bit.ly/2OOzF64\nPeppa Pig Korean: http://bit.ly/2pps03f\nPeppa pig Norwegian: https://bit.ly/2SmQVCQ\nPeppa Pig Polish: http://bit.ly/2MT5qcr\nPeppa Pig Portuguese: http://bit.ly/2pt6CKn\nPeppa Pig Spanish: http://bit.ly/2QPJ8vG\nPeppa Pig Swedish: https://bit.ly/3jnn3SR\n \n\ud83d\udfe5 Subscribe For All The Latest Official Peppa Pig Content: http://bit.ly/PeppaPigYT\n \nPEPPA PIG \u00a9 ASTLEY BAKER DAVIES LTD/ENTERTAINMENT ONE UK LTD 2003.

She is four years old and lives with Mummy Pig, Daddy Pig and her little brother George. \n\nPeppa likes playing with her best friend Suzy Sheep, visiting Granny and Grandpa Pig and looking after George. Most of all, Peppa loves jumping up and down in muddy puddles, laughing and making loud snorting noises. \n\nGeorge Pig is Peppa\u2019s little brother. He is 18 months old and loves to play with his big sister, Peppa \u2013 even when she\u2019s being bossy. George\u2019s favourite thing is his toy dinosaur. He carries it everywhere with him. George can\u2019t speak yet but can say one word very well: \u2018Dine-saw!\u2019 \n\nMummy Pig likes jumping up and down in muddy puddles almost as much as Peppa. She works from home on her computer and sometimes lets Peppa and George help, as long as they don\u2019t bash the keyboard. She is better at map reading than Daddy Pig and is very wise about most things. \nDaddy Pig is very jolly and laughs all the time, especially when he plays with Peppa and George. \n\nDaddy Pig reads the paper and gets excited about trips in the car. He loves cookies and pumpkin pie and Peppa teases him about his big round tummy. Daddy Pig can be a tiny bit grumpy sometimes when he can\u2019t remember where he put his glasses. \n\nHave fun with Peppa Pig and her friends: Suzy Sheep, Rebecca Rabbit, Danny Dog, Candy Cat, Pedro Pony, Zoe Zebra, Emily Elephant, Freddy Fox, Kylie Kangaroo, Wendy Wolf, Gabriella Goat, Gerald Giraffe, Molly Mole, Belinda Bear, Delphine Donkey, Peggi and Pandora Panda, Mandy Mouse, Simon Squirrel! \n\nOur suggestions: \nCocomelon: https://bit.ly/3g3uYpQ \nBabyBus - Nursery Rhymes: https://bit.ly/3fs3U0Y \nLittle Angel: https://bit.ly/3dSmHlP \n\nPEPPA PIG \u00a9 ASTLEY BAKER DAVIES LTD/ENTERTAINMENT ONE UK LTD 2003.

She is four years old and lives with Mummy Pig, Daddy Pig and her little brother George. \n\nPeppa likes playing with her best friend Suzy Sheep, visiting Granny and Grandpa Pig and looking after George. Most of all, Peppa loves jumping up and down in muddy puddles, laughing and making loud snorting noises. \n\nGeorge Pig is Peppa\u2019s little brother. He is 18 months old and loves to play with his big sister, Peppa \u2013 even when she\u2019s being bossy. George\u2019s favourite thing is his toy dinosaur. He carries it everywhere with him. George can\u2019t speak yet but can say one word very well: \u2018Dine-saw!\u2019 \n\nMummy Pig likes jumping up and down in muddy puddles almost as much as Peppa. She works from home on her computer and sometimes lets Peppa and George help, as long as they don\u2019t bash the keyboard. She is better at map reading than Daddy Pig and is very wise about most things. \nDaddy Pig is very jolly and laughs all the time, especially when he plays with Peppa and George. \n\nDaddy Pig reads the paper and gets excited about trips in the car. He loves cookies and pumpkin pie and Peppa teases him about his big round tummy. Daddy Pig can be a tiny bit grumpy sometimes when he can\u2019t remember where he put his glasses. \n\nHave fun with Peppa Pig and her friends: Suzy Sheep, Rebecca Rabbit, Danny Dog, Candy Cat, Pedro Pony, Zoe Zebra, Emily Elephant, Freddy Fox, Kylie Kangaroo, Wendy Wolf, Gabriella Goat, Gerald Giraffe, Molly Mole, Belinda Bear, Delphine Donkey, Peggi and Pandora Panda, Mandy Mouse, Simon Squirrel! \n\nOur suggestions: \nCocomelon: https://bit.ly/3g3uYpQ \nBabyBus - Nursery Rhymes: https://bit.ly/3fs3U0Y \nLittle Angel: https://bit.ly/3dSmHlP \n\nPEPPA PIG \u00a9 ASTLEY BAKER DAVIES LTD/ENTERTAINMENT ONE UK LTD 2003.

She is four years old and lives with Mummy Pig, Daddy Pig and her little brother George. \n\nPeppa likes playing with her best friend Suzy Sheep, visiting Granny and Grandpa Pig and looking after George. Most of all, Peppa loves jumping up and down in muddy puddles, laughing and making loud snorting noises. \n\nGeorge Pig is Peppa\u2019s little brother. He is 18 months old and loves to play with his big sister, Peppa \u2013 even when she\u2019s being bossy. George\u2019s favourite thing is his toy dinosaur. He carries it everywhere with him. George can\u2019t speak yet but can say one word very well: \u2018Dine-saw!\u2019 \n\nMummy Pig likes jumping up and down in muddy puddles almost as much as Peppa. She works from home on her computer and sometimes lets Peppa and George help, as long as they don\u2019t bash the keyboard. She is better at map reading than Daddy Pig and is very wise about most things. \nDaddy Pig is very jolly and laughs all the time, especially when he plays with Peppa and George. \n\nDaddy Pig reads the paper and gets excited about trips in the car. He loves cookies and pumpkin pie and Peppa teases him about his big round tummy. Daddy Pig can be a tiny bit grumpy sometimes when he can\u2019t remember where he put his glasses. \n\nHave fun with Peppa Pig and her friends: Suzy Sheep, Rebecca Rabbit, Danny Dog, Candy Cat, Pedro Pony, Zoe Zebra, Emily Elephant, Freddy Fox, Kylie Kangaroo, Wendy Wolf, Gabriella Goat, Gerald Giraffe, Molly Mole, Belinda Bear, Delphine Donkey, Peggi and Pandora Panda, Mandy Mouse, Simon Squirrel! \n\nOur suggestions: \nCocomelon: https://bit.ly/3g3uYpQ \nBabyBus - Nursery Rhymes: https://bit.ly/3fs3U0Y \nLittle Angel: https://bit.ly/3dSmHlP \n\nPEPPA PIG \u00a9 ASTLEY BAKER DAVIES LTD/ENTERTAINMENT ONE UK LTD 2003.

She is four years old and lives with Mummy Pig, Daddy Pig and her little brother George. Peppa likes playing with her best friend Suzy Sheep, visiting Granny and Grandpa Pig and looking after George. Most of all, Peppa loves jumping up and down in muddy puddles, laughing and making loud snorting noises. \nGeorge Pig is Peppa\u2019s little brother. He is 18 months old and loves to play with his big sister, Peppa \u2013 even when she\u2019s being bossy. George\u2019s favourite thing is his toy dinosaur. He carries it everywhere with him. George can\u2019t speak yet but can say one word very well: \u2018Dine-saw!\u2019 \nMummy Pig likes jumping up and down in muddy puddles almost as much as Peppa. She works from home on her computer and sometimes lets Peppa and George help, as long as they don\u2019t bash the keyboard. She is better at map reading than Daddy Pig and is very wise about most things. \nDaddy Pig is very jolly and laughs all the time, especially when he plays with Peppa and George. Daddy Pig reads the paper and gets excited about trips in the car. He loves cookies and pumpkin pie and Peppa teases him about his big round tummy. Daddy Pig can be a tiny bit grumpy sometimes when he can\u2019t remember where he put his glasses. \n\nHave fun with Peppa Pig and her friends: Suzy Sheep, Rebecca Rabbit, Danny Dog, Candy Cat, Pedro Pony, Zoe Zebra, Emily Elephant, Freddy Fox, Kylie Kangaroo, Wendy Wolf, Gabriella Goat, Gerald Giraffe, Molly Mole, Belinda Bear, Delphine Donkey, Peggi and Pandora Panda, Mandy Mouse, Simon Squirrel! \n\nOur suggestions: \nCocomelon: https://bit.ly/3g3uYpQ \nBabyBus - Nursery Rhymes: https://bit.ly/3fs3U0Y \nLittle Angel: https://bit.ly/3dSmHlP \n\nPEPPA PIG \u00a9 ASTLEY BAKER DAVIES LTD/ENTERTAINMENT ONE UK LTD 2003.
