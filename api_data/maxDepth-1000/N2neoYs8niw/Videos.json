OUT MARCH 24*\nAnnouncing the release of Pink Floyd\u2019s \u2018The Dark Side Of The Moon\u2019 as a deluxe box set to celebrate 50 years since the release of one of the best-selling albums of all time. Newly remastered, the box set was released on 24th March 2023. Order here: https://pinkfloyd.lnk.to/DarkSide50th\n\nOne of the most iconic and influential albums ever, Pink Floyd\u2019s \u2018The Dark Side Of The Moon\u2019 continues to find new audiences globally. The album was partly developed during live performances, and the band premiered an early version of the suite at London\u2019s Rainbow Theatre several months before recording began. \u2018The Dark Side Of The Moon\u2019 is the eighth studio album by Pink Floyd, originally released in the US on 1 March and then in the UK on 16th March 1973.  The new material was recorded in 1972 and 1973 at EMI Studios (now Abbey Road studios) in London. The iconic sleeve, which depicts a prism spectrum, was designed by Storm Thorgerson of Hipgnosis and drawn by George Hardie. \u2018The Dark Side Of The Moon\u2019 has sold over 50 million copies worldwide.\n\n\n*'THE DARK SIDE OF THE MOON - LIVE AT WEMBLEY EMPIRE POOL, LONDON, 1974\u2019*\nSimultaneously, on 24th March, the CD and first ever vinyl issue of Pink Floyd\u2019s \u2018The Dark Side Of The Moon - Live At Wembley Empire Pool, London, 1974\u2019 will be released independently. It was originally recorded in November 1974 as part of the band\u2019s winter tour and this is the first time it will be available as a stand-alone album, with artwork featuring an original 1973 line-drawn cover by George Hardie.\n\n*ANIMATED VIDEO COMPETITION*\nThe 50th Anniversary release will also be celebrated as Pink Floyd invite a new generation of animators to enter a competition to create music videos for any of the 10 songs on the iconic 1973 album. Pink Floyd has a rich history of collaborating with animators from the beginnings of the band (Ian Emes, Gerald Scarfe etc.), and in some cases the visuals that accompany the songs have become synonymous with the music itself. The 50th Anniversary will be no exception. The band would like to give all animators an opportunity to present a fresh take on these timeless aural works. Animators can enter up to 10 videos, one per song on the album. A winner will be selected from a panel of experts which will include Pink Floyd\u2019s Nick Mason, Aubrey 'Po' Powell (Pink Floyd's creative director) and the BFI (British Film Institute). The deadline for submissions is December 31st 2023. To enter and for more information go to https://www.pinkfloyd.com/competition/\n\n*PINK FLOYD - THE DARK SIDE OF THE MOON: 50TH ANNIVERSARY BOOK*\nThe book Pink Floyd - The Dark Side Of The Moon: 50th Anniversary will also be published separately by Thames & Hudson on March 24, 2023 to coincide with the box set release. Curated by photographer Jill Furmanovsky and art directed by Hipgnosis co-founder Aubrey Powell, this LP-sized volume showcases rare and previously unseen photographs taken during The Dark Side Of The Moon tours of 1972-1975 and was created with the involvement of the band members.\n\n*NEW PLANETARIUM ALBUM EXPERIENCE ANNOUNCED*\nFifty years on, in recognition of the iconic album and with the help of huge strides in technology, an official full dome experience with stunning visuals of the solar system and beyond and played out to 42 minutes of The Dark Side Of The Moon, will be released in Planetariums around the world in March. Contact your local Planetarium for any screening details.\n\nThe show itself will be divided between the 10 tracks off the album, in chronological order, each having a different theme; some futuristically looking forward and some a retro acknowledgment to Pink Floyd\u2019s visual history, all relating to a time and space experience, embracing up to the minute technology that only a Planetarium can offer. It promises to be immersive; an all-encompassing surround sound and visual treat that will transcend reality and take you way beyond the realms of 2D experience.  \n\n\n*PINK FLOYD SOCIAL MEDIA*\nYouTube https://PinkFloyd.lnk.to/OfficialYouTube\nFacebook https://PinkFloyd.lnk.to/OfficialFacebook\nInstagram https://PinkFloyd.lnk.to/OfficialInstagram\nTwitter https://PinkFloyd.lnk.to/OfficialTwitter\nTikTok https://PinkFloyd.lnk.to/OfficialTikTok\nThreads https://pinkfloyd.lnk.to/OfficialThreads\nSpotify https://PinkFloyd.lnk.to/Spotify\nApple Music https://PinkFloyd.lnk.to/AppleMusic\n\n#pinkfloyd #documentary #tdsotm #TDSOTM50",

                    "description": "\"Slipknot: The Devil in I\" is a blistering track from the band's fifth studio album, \".5: The Gray Chapter.\" Released in 2014, this song serves as a ferocious declaration of resilience and empowerment amidst adversity, while also delving into themes of personal transformation and inner conflict.\n\nThe track opens with a menacing and atmospheric introduction, featuring eerie synths and distorted vocals, setting a dark and foreboding tone. This unsettling atmosphere quickly gives way to a barrage of pounding drums, churning guitars, and pulsating basslines as the song kicks into high gear.\n\nCorey Taylor's vocals are a highlight of \"The Devil in I,\" alternating between menacing growls and soaring melodic hooks. His lyrics are cryptic yet evocative, painting a picture of internal struggle and defiance in the face of inner demons. Lines like \"Undo these chains, my friend / I'll show you the rage I've hidden\" capture the intense emotional intensity of the song, as the protagonist grapples with their own darkness.\n\nThe chorus of \"The Devil in I\" is anthemic and unforgettable, with Taylor's vocals soaring over a backdrop of crushing riffs and thunderous percussion. The refrain, \"The devil in I / Is ready to thrive / We'll never survive\" is delivered with a sense of defiant resolve, as if embracing the darkness within as a source of strength rather than weakness.\n\nMusically, \"The Devil in I\" showcases Slipknot's trademark blend of aggression and melody, with razor-sharp guitar riffs, frenetic drumming, and atmospheric synths creating a dense and immersive sonic landscape. The production is slick and polished, yet retains a raw and visceral edge that captures the band's visceral live energy.\n\nOverall, \"Slipknot: The Devil in I\" is a potent and adrenaline-fueled anthem that captures the band at the height of their powers. With its blend of crushing heaviness, infectious melodies, and thought-provoking lyricism, it stands as a standout track in Slipknot's catalog, resonating with fans of heavy music worldwide.\nSongteksten\nStep inside and see, the Devil in I!\nAre you with us out there, you have beaten motherfuckers?\nHere we go!\n\u00a1Uno!\n\u00a1Dos!\n\u00a1Tres!\n\u00a1Cuatro!\nAye!\nAye!\nCan you feel us out there, Mexico?\nUndo these chains, my friend\nI'll show you the rage I've hidden\nPerish the Sacrament\nSwallow, but nothing's forgiven\nYou and I can't decide, which of us was taken for granted\nMake amends, some of us are destined to be outlived\nCome on!\nStep inside\nSee The Devil In I!\nToo many times, we've let it come to this\nStep inside (come on)\nSee The Devil In I!\nYou'll realize I'm not your Devil anymore (oh yeah, Mexico)\nUnder the words of men\nSomething is tempting the Father\nWhere is your will, my friend?\nInsatiates never even bother\nYou and I, wrong or right, traded a lie for the leverage\nIn between lens in light, you're not what you seem\nCome on!\nStep inside\nSee The Devil In I!\nToo many times, we've let it come to this\nStep inside\nSee The Devil In I!\nYou'll realize I'm not your Devil (fuck yeah, Mexico!)\nI'm not your Devil anymore\nYour station is abandoned, fooled you 'cause I know what you've done\nSensation deprivation, you should've burned when you turned on everyone\nSo step inside\nSee the Devil In I!\nToo many times, we've let it come to this\nStep inside (come on!)\nSee the Devil In I!\nI know you'll find your answers in the end\nStep inside\nSee the Devil In I!\nYou'll realize I'm not your Devil anymore\nSo step inside\nStep inside\nSee the Devil in I!\nSee the Devil in I!\n\u00a1Gracias!, \u00a1buenas noches!",

Most people think the path to a better life involves controlling every possible aspect of their life, but the truth is there is so much we will never be able to control, and the best path to a free life is by shifting your perspective to a larger 20,000 feet view. This song is a call to release control and trust that at 20,000 feet everything will make sense.\n\n\u2014\u2014\n\n\ud83d\udc49 If you open up about your mental health in the comments using @heartsupport, we\u2019ll write back to you.\n\nIf you want direction in your mental health journey, you can go to https://heartsupport.com/compass to take our self-assessment test and get personalized PDF results.\n\nHere are all of our other links:\n\nAnonymous Mental Health Forum: https://forum.heartsupport.com/\n\nVolunteer on a Reply Team: https://www.heartsupport.com/swat\n\nHeartSupport Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/heartsupport\n\nHeartSupport Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/heartsupport\n\nHeartSupport Twitter: https://www.twitter.com/heartsupport\n\nHeartSupport TikTok: https://www.tiktok.com/@heartsupport\n\nDownload the HeartSupport SOS App from the App Store or Play Store\n\nYou can donate to HeartSupport at https://www.heartsupport.com/donate\nhttp://www.heartsupport.com/\n\n#systemofadown #Aerials #Toxicity"

I keep an ongoing record of the long road to Ch\u00e2teau ownership, and you can visit our website by clicking on this link... https://www.atthechateau.com - If you would like to receive my newsletter that announces new posts, please visit the website and subscribe.\n\nYou can also find us on instagram at atthechateau.france or https://www.instagram.com/atthechatea...\n\nAnd FaceBook at https://www.facebook.com/atthechateau...\n\nWe would like to thank all of our Patrons who are helping to restore this historic monument, their contributions are invaluable to our efforts.

You might be wondering, is floral design easy? Well, with my step-by-step instructions, you'll be amazed at how simple it is to create a stunning floral arrangement. We start with bellflowers to create the structure, then use a garden rose as the focal point, add some spray roses to fill out the shape, and ranunculus to create movement. To fill in the holes, we add more roses with a beautiful scent and finish off with star of Bethlehem that will continue blooming day after day.

The solution is a flower frog, otherwise known as a kenzan. In this video, I demonstrate how easy flower frogs are to use without any flower-arranging experience.\n\nFlower frogs are reusable, durable, weighted holders for cut flowers. They can transform the smallest egg cup or largest dish into a vessel fit for a top florist. Originally used for Ikebana, the ancient Japanese art of flower arranging, the ease with which they make cut flowers and foliage come alive in a modern, contemporary way is now appreciated worldwide.\n\nYou can shop from a wide range of flower frogs, decorative bowls and flower scissors on my website at www.dancoopergarden.com.\n\n00:00 Introduction.\n00:09 What is a flower frog?\n00:44 Different shapes and sizes of flower frogs.\n01:22 Using flower-shaped bowls.\n01:42 Getting started with your arrangement.\n02:28 Placing the stems on your flower frog.\n04:54 Take a step back to check your display.\n05:10 What do with very short stems.\n05:25 How to disguise the flower frog.\n06:20 Where to buy.",

Astronauts who have been on long-duration flights to the ISS have experienced vision problems, cardiovascular issues, bone loss, elevated CO2 levels, reduced cognition, and more.\n\nAll of these issues will be exacerbated on a Mars trip because the shortest trip to Mars would be far longer than the longest any human has ever been in space (Valeri Polyakov spent 14 months in space in 1995).\n\nRadiation and cosmic rays will be an issue. Almost all of the time we've spent in space has been in low Earth orbit (LEO), which is under the Earth's magnetic shield. The trip to Mars would expose the passengers to all the solar radiation and comic rays that our magnetic shield blocks, and studies have shown that the 24 Apollo astronauts that flew to the Moon showed a 5x greater incidence of cardiovascular disease later in life.\n\nImmune system issues. Studies have shown that astronauts' immune systems are reduced when weightless and bacteria become stronger at the same time. Outbreaks in the enclosed environment on Mars would be an issue.\n\nThe conditions of Mars. Mars only has 1% of the atmosphere of Earth and even that is carbon dioxide, which we can't breathe. It also makes temperatures vary widely. Plus the soil is filled with perchlorate, which affects our endocrine system and can cause breathing problems.\n\nLINKS LINKS LINKS:\n\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2014/01/28/science/bodies-not-made-for-space.html\n\nhttps://image.gsfc.nasa.gov/poetry/venus/q2811.html\n\nhttps://www.space.com/33571-apollo-astronauts-heart-risk-deep-space-travel.html\n\nPerchlorate:\nhttps://www.epa.gov/sites/production/files/2014-03/documents/ffrrofactsheet_contaminant_perchlorate_january2014_final.pdf\n\nVideo of astronauts landing:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhOQ1Xz7oOo\n\nhttps://www.voanews.com/silicon-valley-technology/study-immune-system-weakens-space",
