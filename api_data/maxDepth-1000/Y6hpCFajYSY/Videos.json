Shirts will be longer at the front and shorter at the back. Easy DIY cutting clothing tutorial. \n\nSubscribe to the Cinderella Sew channel for more easy ways to alter your clothes. Easy DIY clothing tutorials and tricks!\n\nI started cutting up old clothing when I was a teenager. I taught myself and figured out (by making mistakes) all the tricks on how to easily alter clothes. I used to use a machine, but now I do hand sewing and lots of things with just scissors.\n\nT-shirts are my favourite because they are easy to cut up and don\u2019t fray when they are cut. This means you can make all sorts of designs by just cutting them, and don't have to worry about sewing hems or finishing seams. Just cut and go! \n\nMost tutorials take less than five minutes and you can learn how to experiment with your own ideas and designs. I just give you the basic techniques.\n\nWatch the Cinderella Sew video tutorials and learn easy ways to recycle, change, and restyle your clothing. Fashion changes, styles come and go, and it is always fun to remix what you are wearing.\nYou will end up with clothing that you feel good wearing because you made it look exactly how you want it to. Yeoh!\n\nThanks for watching, I appreciate your comments and your support. Peace and love from Cinderella Sew!"

My friend sent me this Free People dress almost a year ago and I loved it!! I knew it would be a perfect #thriftflip because we could mashup a graphic t-shirt or sweatshirt with a printed Maxi Skirt for a fraction of the cost. \n\nthis is a great DIY for beginner sewers because there is one single seam with a straight stich. \nYou can add detailing in the waist with pleats and gathers if you want, but no need! Simple looks amazing. \n\nTIP:\nStart by looking for a cool skirt that you think you'd like and THEN hunt for a t-shirt or sweatshirt that complements it.\nMaxi skirts are harder to find so you want to let that dictate your design. \n\nIf you try my DIYs, make sure to tag me on my socials!\nINSTAGRAM: https://www.instagram.com/orlyshani\nTWITTER: https://twitter.com/orlyshani\n\nMATERIALS\nMaxi skirt or dress\nT-shirt or sweatshirt\nsewing machine\nscissors\n\n#DIY #OrlyShani #freepeople",

My friend sent me this Free People dress almost a year ago and I loved it!! I knew it would be a perfect #thriftflip because we could mashup a graphic t-shirt or sweatshirt with a printed Maxi Skirt for a fraction of the cost. \n\nthis is a great DIY for beginner sewers because there is one single seam with a straight stich. \nYou can add detailing in the waist with pleats and gathers if you want, but no need! Simple looks amazing. \n\nTIP:\nStart by looking for a cool skirt that you think you'd like and THEN hunt for a t-shirt or sweatshirt that complements it.\nMaxi skirts are harder to find so you want to let that dictate your design. \n\nIf you try my DIYs, make sure to tag me on my socials!\nINSTAGRAM: https://www.instagram.com/orlyshani\nTWITTER: https://twitter.com/orlyshani\n\nMATERIALS\nMaxi skirt or dress\nT-shirt or sweatshirt\nsewing machine\nscissors\n\n#DIY #OrlyShani #freepeople"

That usually happens as Spring and Summer rolls around ;) \n It's so artsy and handmade feeling. Lots of embellishment and details that looks super DIY and handmade, which is perfect for us!!\n\nTIPS\n-Buy your tablecloth first! It's easier to find different pants that are going to work with the tablecloth, than the other way around. It just helps your refine your search a little. \n- Consider a Tablerunner instead of a tablecloth, if you're only making one piece. \n\nIf you try my DIYs, make sure to tag me on my socials!\nINSTAGRAM: https://www.instagram.com/orlyshani\nTWITTER: https://twitter.com/orlyshani\n\nMATERIALS\nPants\nTablecloth\nSeam ripper\nFabric Glue\nSewing Machine (optional\n\n#DIY #OrlyShani #NoSew"

                        "description": "I wanted to know if dressing for your body shape REALLY matters, and how exactly dressing for your body type can improve your personal style. I get a comment almost DAILY telling me that I either \"don't know how to dress for my body shape\" or instructing me that I \"should dress for my body type\", and I wanted to know more about what this all means. So I sat down with @elliejeanroyden of Body & Style to learn all about the Kibbe Body Type System, and her own Body Matrix system. We dive into  what my own body type is, and how knowing my your body type can potentially help you dress better. \n\nWatch the FULL interview with Ellie-Jean on my Patreon \u27a1\ufe0f https://www.patreon.com/Christinamychas \n\nSubscribe to @elliejeanroyden \nBook a consult Ellie-Jean here \u27a1\ufe0f https://www.bodyandstyle.com/\nEllie-Jean Tiktok https://www.tiktok.com/@bodyandstyle?lang=en\nInstagram https://www.instagram.com/elliejeanroyden/\n\n\ud83d\udc57BOOK A 1-ON-1 STYLING SESSION WITH ME - let's shop your closet!  - https://www.myindyx.com/personal-stylists/christinamychas\n\n\u2728 Get more exclusive content on my Patreon! https://www.patreon.com/Christinamychas \n\n\ud83c\udf88Shop more of my favorite products here: https://shopmy.us/christinamychas\n\u2728 my Mejuri jewelry faves https://mejurifinecrew.sjv.io/c/2699448/1006980/13190 \n\ud83d\udc57 follow me on LTK & exact products from my my posts here: https://www.shopltk.com/explore/christina.mychas\n\ud83c\udfe1 my small space organization favorites Shop my small wardrobe organization here! \u27a1\ufe0f https://www.amazon.ca/shop/christinamychas \n\n\ud83d\udc56 I get all my vintage denim here! \ud83d\udc98 https://bit.ly/43NsxOm\n\nhow to build a capsule wardrobe & find your personal style WITHOUT shopping https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5j5jhvZl9G0&t=1s\n\n\ud83c\udfa7 SUBSCRIBE TO OUR SLOW FASHION PODCAST \n@SustainThis_Podcast  https://www.youtube.com/@SustainThis_Podcast \n\nMY FREEBIES TOOLKIT \ud83c\udf8a\n\ud83e\udd73 FREE Find Your Style Uniform Notion Template HERE \u27a1\ufe0f  https://view.flodesk.com/pages/635dc3a5647f997fb25c8919  \n\ud83d\udce6 FREE decluttering checklist here!  https://view.flodesk.com/pages/6298038b513edb17a2c41f0f\n\ud83c\udf43 FREE monthly Minimalist-ish Newsletter for more intentional living & style tips https://view.flodesk.com/pages/62a35af478fb7e7c5a8ef5fe \n\ud83d\udc57 FREE Cost-Per-Wear Wardrobe Tracking Spreadsheet https://bit.ly/3lPJ8eu\n\ud83d\udcb8 The Budgeting App I Use https://bit.ly/35SgX8G\n\nWATCH FOR MORE \ud83d\udc40\nHow to find your style WITHOUT shopping https://youtu.be/5j5jhvZl9G0\nWho makes the BEST white t-shirt? https://youtu.be/1RjnFVBT93Y\nHow to be an outfit repeater & find your style uniform https://youtu.be/dRgTjy97wAA \nLife-changing habits to improve your style https://youtu.be/D7HdmIClXrI\n\nFIND ME HERE \ud83d\udc99\n\ud83d\udecd Private Low Buy Beauties Shopping Support Group http://bit.ly/2R3AHxC \nBook a 1-on-1 closet edit with me!- https://www.myindyx.com/personal-stylists/christinamychas\n\ud83d\udcf8 Instagram https://www.instagram.com/christina.m...\n\ud83d\udcf1 TikTok https://bit.ly/2WaELlQ\n\ud83d\udcbb My Minimalist-ish Website https://www.minimalist-ish.com/ \n\u2728 Get more exclusive content on Patreon https://www.patreon.com/Christinamychas \n\nFor business inquires, contact: sarah.smyth@platformmedia.ca\n\nCodes & Discounts (if you want to)\ud83e\udd18\ud83c\udffb\n\ud83e\uddfa TRU EARTH Eco Friendly Laundry Strips - save 10% with code CHRISTINA10 at checkout! https://bit.ly/41D6pVG\n\u2728 PAMELA CARD JEWELLERY - female-owned Canadian heirloom jewellery.

If you choose to use these links, thank you for your support! :-)\n\nAlso note that I go out of my way to find eco-friendly alternatives - either straight from an eco-brand or from a brand that is improving qualities (organic cotton, recycled polyester etc.).\n\n Pls. read my disclaimer for products linked and more transparency: http://www.uselesswardrobe.dk/disclaimer/\n\n\u25ba Music credit: Epidemicsound.com (Youtube creator song library)\n\u25ba Editing: Done by me\n\u25ba Pictures: mostly my own or a few paid-for via Shutterstock\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n#colouranalysis #slowfashion #capsulewardrobe"

Although Emma McAdam is a licensed marriage and family therapist, the views expressed on this site or any related content should not be taken for medical or psychiatric advice. Always consult your physician before making any decisions related to your physical or mental health.\nIn therapy I use a combination of Acceptance and Commitment Therapy, Systems Theory, positive psychology, and a bio-psycho-social approach to treating mental illness and other challenges we all face in life. The ideas from my videos are frequently adapted from multiple sources. Many of them come from Acceptance and Commitment Therapy, especially the work of Steven Hayes, Jason Luoma, and Russ Harris. The sections on stress and the mind-body connection derive from the work of Stephen Porges (the Polyvagal theory), Peter Levine (Somatic Experiencing) Francine Shapiro (EMDR), and Bessel Van Der Kolk. I also rely heavily on the work of the Arbinger institute for my overall understanding of our ability to choose our life's direction. \nAnd deeper than all of that, the Gospel of Jesus Christ orients my personal worldview and sense of security, peace, hope, and love https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/comeuntochrist/believe\n\nIf you are in crisis, please contact the National Suicide Prevention Hotline at https://suicidepreventionlifeline.org/ or 1-800-273-TALK (8255) or your local emergency services.\nCopyright Therapy in a Nutshell, LLC",

For example, you might not go to a social activity because your automatic negative thought says \u201cYou\u2019ll have a terrible time,\u201d and that can lead to missed opportunities, isolation, and a cycle of feeling worse and worse.\n\nIn this video you\u2019ll learn about the automatic negative thoughts that fuel the anxiety cycle and lead to feeling overwhelmed or hopeless. You probably aren\u2019t even aware of the types of thoughts that take you there, so we\u2019ll explore them.

This video introduces the ACT technique of cognitive defusion, a pivotal concept for those seeking to learn how to stop overthinking. Instead of wrestling with our thoughts and overthinking potential outcomes, cognitive defusion teaches us to observe our thoughts without attachment. By labeling and noticing thoughts as just thoughts, we learn how to stop overthinking by distancing ourselves from these mental processes, thus reducing their impact. Knowing how to stop overthinking doesn't mean engaging in a struggle with our inner dialogue, but rather, shifting our attention to what truly aligns with our values, freeing us from the tiresome cycle of overthinking. This skill, central to understanding how to stop overthinking, requires practice to master, but can ultimately guide us to a more present and less anxiety-driven existence.\n\nLooking for affordable online counseling?

The video explains that worry is a natural but often maladaptive part of the brain's problem-solving process and suggests scheduled worry as a technique to help manage it. This involves setting aside a daily period to focus on worries, thereby confining them to a specific time and place, which is an exercise in how to stop worrying and start living. By practicing this technique, viewers are told they can expect to reduce their overall anxiety significantly, as it trains the brain to set boundaries on worry, leading to more worry-free moments throughout the day. The video aims to empower viewers with the skills to redirect their attention away from chronic worry and towards living a more engaged and fulfilling life, highlighting the journey of how to stop worrying and start living.\n\nLooking for affordable online counseling?

The video explains that worry is a natural but often maladaptive part of the brain's problem-solving process and suggests scheduled worry as a technique to help manage it. This involves setting aside a daily period to focus on worries, thereby confining them to a specific time and place, which is an exercise in how to stop worrying and start living. By practicing this technique, viewers are told they can expect to reduce their overall anxiety significantly, as it trains the brain to set boundaries on worry, leading to more worry-free moments throughout the day. The video aims to empower viewers with the skills to redirect their attention away from chronic worry and towards living a more engaged and fulfilling life, highlighting the journey of how to stop worrying and start living.\n\nLooking for affordable online counseling?

He distinguished between thought control and attention control, underscoring that while we can't directly control our thoughts, we can choose where to focus our attention. This focus is crucial, as \"what you focus on becomes your reality.\" Wignall also highlighted the importance of practicing mindfulness not as a coping mechanism during anxious moments but as a regular exercise to strengthen attention control. He proposed a simple, non-judgmental mindfulness practice focusing on breath and attention redirection, advocating for its regular practice to effectively train the brain and alter its response to anxiety.

Try it now for 10% off your first month: https://betterhelp.com/therapyinanutshell\n\nCatastrophizing makes you anxious. When you visualize all the awful things happening, it literally turns on your physical stress response in the present moment. You create the reality of that catastrophe in your body when you imagine yourself failing, being rejected, getting harmed, or struggling in the future. Catastrophizing creates the perception of danger and hopelessness right in the present moment. Your brain uses it's imagination and ability to visualize the future to help protect you. Catastrophizing is essentially a defense mechanism but one that isn\u2019t the best, it backfires. It can contribute to depression and anxiety and other mental health conditions. So let\u2019s replace it with a more helpful one. \nIn this video you'll learn how to use the skill of mental imagery to combat anxiety and create greater chances of success. You'll learn to ask \u201cWhat if it all works out?\u201d Let\u2019s visualize ourselves working through challenges. You can physiologically create a sense of confidence and efficacy with the simple exercise- what if everything works out? \n\nLearn more in one of my in-depth mental health courses: https://courses.therapyinanutshell.com/?utm_medium=YTDescription&utm_source=YouTube\nSupport my mission on Patreon: https://www.patreon.com/therapyinanutshell\nSign up for my newsletter: https://www.therapyinanutshell.com?utm_medium=YTDescription&utm_source=YouTube\nCheck out my favorite self-help books: https://kit.co/TherapyinaNutshell/best-self-help-books\nCheck out my podcast, Therapy in a Nutshell: https://tinpodcast.podbean.com/\n\nTherapy in a Nutshell and the information provided by Emma McAdam are solely intended for informational and entertainment purposes and are not a substitute for advice, diagnosis, or treatment regarding medical or mental health conditions.

My sponsor, BetterHelp, connects you to a licensed professional from the comfort of your own home. Try it now for 10% off your first month: https://betterhelp.com/therapyinanutshell\n\nCatastrophizing makes you anxious. When you visualize all the awful things happening, it literally turns on your physical stress response in the present moment. You create the reality of that catastrophe in your body when you imagine yourself failing, being rejected, getting harmed, or struggling in the future. Catastrophizing creates the perception of danger and hopelessness right in the present moment. Your brain uses it's imagination and ability to visualize the future to help protect you. Catastrophizing is essentially a defense mechanism but one that isn\u2019t the best, it backfires. It can contribute to depression and anxiety and other mental health conditions. So let\u2019s replace it with a more helpful one. \nIn this video you'll learn how to use the skill of mental imagery to combat anxiety and create greater chances of success. You'll learn to ask \u201cWhat if it all works out?\u201d Let\u2019s visualize ourselves working through challenges. You can physiologically create a sense of confidence and efficacy with the simple exercise- what if everything works out? \n\nLearn more in one of my in-depth mental health courses: https://courses.therapyinanutshell.com/?utm_medium=YTDescription&utm_source=YouTube\nSupport my mission on Patreon: https://www.patreon.com/therapyinanutshell\nSign up for my newsletter: https://www.therapyinanutshell.com?utm_medium=YTDescription&utm_source=YouTube\nCheck out my favorite self-help books: https://kit.co/TherapyinaNutshell/best-self-help-books\nCheck out my podcast, Therapy in a Nutshell: https://tinpodcast.podbean.com/\n\nTherapy in a Nutshell and the information provided by Emma McAdam are solely intended for informational and entertainment purposes and are not a substitute for advice, diagnosis, or treatment regarding medical or mental health conditions.

You can usually recognize it when you use words like \u201cAlways, Never, Perfect, Terrible, Everything, Everyone, Nothing, Nobody, Worst, or Best. The Arbinger Institute calls these \u201cHorribilizations\u201d You take something and horriblize it. \n\nNotice how in these situations, black and white thinking exaggerates the situation. \nA husband says to his wife: \u201cYou NEVER do the dishes! I ALWAYS have to clean up after you!\u201d\nDepressed Young Adult: \u201cEVERYthing is awful. The world is a TERRIBLE place. Climate change is HOPELESS.  I\u2019ll NEVER be able to succeed. I\u2019m NO good at math\u201d  \nSomeone at work: My boss is the WORST communicator. \nA young mother: \u201cI\u2019m just a TERRIBLE person\u201d or \u201cShe has it ALL together, she\u2019s such a SAINT\u201d\nEach time, the person takes a difficult situation and makes it horrible. They use the most extreme word. Never. Always. Everything. Hopeless. Terrible. \n\nThe more extreme your thinking, the more intense your emotions will be, and the more likely you are to be depressed or anxious. But Black and White thinking also makes you helpless to escape that depression or anxiety. And it\u2019s a lie. When you use B&W thinking, you are usually distorting nuanced reality by ignoring the good and exaggerating the bad. You\u2019re lying. \n\nIf it\u2019s so awful, why do we do it? \nYou subconsciously like black and white thinking because it serves a function in the short term. And like a drug, it makes you suffer in the long term. So what function does it serve?\n\n00:00 Introduction to Emotional Reactivity\n00:38 How to Identify Black and White Thinking\n02:36 Why do we \"like\" black and white thinking?\n05:52 How to be less emotionally reactive\n06:15 How to reframe black and white thinking\n07:10 How to think in the gray\n10:15 summary of how to be less emotionally reactive\nSupport my mission on Patreon: https://www.patreon.com/therapyinanutshell\nSign up for my newsletter: https://courses.therapyinanutshell.com/free-resources\nCheck out my favorite self-help books: https://kit.co/TherapyinaNutshell/best-self-help-books\nCheck out my podcast, Therapy in a Nutshell: https://tinpodcast.podbean.com/\n\nTherapy in a Nutshell and the information provided by Emma McAdam are solely intended for informational and entertainment purposes and are not a substitute for advice, diagnosis, or treatment regarding medical or mental health conditions.

You can usually recognize it when you use words like \u201cAlways, Never, Perfect, Terrible, Everything, Everyone, Nothing, Nobody, Worst, or Best. The Arbinger Institute calls these \u201cHorribilizations\u201d You take something and horriblize it. \n\nNotice how in these situations, black and white thinking exaggerates the situation. \nA husband says to his wife: \u201cYou NEVER do the dishes! I ALWAYS have to clean up after you!\u201d\nDepressed Young Adult: \u201cEVERYthing is awful. The world is a TERRIBLE place. Climate change is HOPELESS.  I\u2019ll NEVER be able to succeed. I\u2019m NO good at math\u201d  \nSomeone at work: My boss is the WORST communicator. \nA young mother: \u201cI\u2019m just a TERRIBLE person\u201d or \u201cShe has it ALL together, she\u2019s such a SAINT\u201d\nEach time, the person takes a difficult situation and makes it horrible. They use the most extreme word. Never. Always. Everything. Hopeless. Terrible. \n\nThe more extreme your thinking, the more intense your emotions will be, and the more likely you are to be depressed or anxious. But Black and White thinking also makes you helpless to escape that depression or anxiety. And it\u2019s a lie. When you use B&W thinking, you are usually distorting nuanced reality by ignoring the good and exaggerating the bad. You\u2019re lying. \n\nIf it\u2019s so awful, why do we do it? \nYou subconsciously like black and white thinking because it serves a function in the short term. And like a drug, it makes you suffer in the long term. So what function does it serve?\n\n00:00 Introduction to Emotional Reactivity\n00:38 How to Identify Black and White Thinking\n02:36 Why do we \"like\" black and white thinking?\n05:52 How to be less emotionally reactive\n06:15 How to reframe black and white thinking\n07:10 How to think in the gray\n10:15 summary of how to be less emotionally reactive\nSupport my mission on Patreon: https://www.patreon.com/therapyinanutshell\nSign up for my newsletter: https://courses.therapyinanutshell.com/free-resources\nCheck out my favorite self-help books: https://kit.co/TherapyinaNutshell/best-self-help-books\nCheck out my podcast, Therapy in a Nutshell: https://tinpodcast.podbean.com/\n\nTherapy in a Nutshell and the information provided by Emma McAdam are solely intended for informational and entertainment purposes and are not a substitute for advice, diagnosis, or treatment regarding medical or mental health conditions.

Your thoughts twist reality, and you start to feel like you\u2019re bad, broken, or deficient. Or you begin to see the world as dangerous, threatening, or cruel. \nBut here\u2019s the thing with cognitive distortions: you don\u2019t realize you\u2019re doing it. You think the way you see things is reality. It feels true. When you think or talk through the lens of a cognitive distortion, you sound rational and accurate to yourself. So is there anything you can do about this? Cognitive Behavioral Therapy can help you change how you feel by changing how you think. \nThe first step is to learn what cognitive distortions are and notice when you\u2019re using them. \n\nLooking for affordable online therapy?

This video will teach you the skill of cognitive defusion, which will help you separate yourself from your thoughts so that you can look at them rather than through them.\n\nIntrusive thoughts can be scary, dark or painful. They can make you worry that you're losing your mind. they are associated with OCD but they can also just pop up out of nowhere. But Intrusive thoughts don't have to ruin your life. \nOverthinking is another problem that many people face, constantly dwelling on thoughts or rehashing them over and over. \nWe swim through our thoughts like a fish swims through water.

Sometimes you fight them or struggle against them, but that doesn\u2019t feel any better. \nSo sometimes you get stuck in an endless loop of overthinking, obsessively struggling against a thought. But that\u2019s not any better, because struggle steals your attention and energy. \nIn this video you\u2019re going to learn how to get unstuck from your intrusive thoughts and break free from patterns of overthinking.

A fixed mindset can keep you stuck feeling depressed or anxious. In this video you\u2019re going to learn how to tell if you have a growth or a fixed mindset, how to develop a growth mindset in regards to mental health. And why having a growth mindset can completely change how you feel about your mental health. \nCarol Dweck, the author of Mindset (which this video is based off of) said \u201cIn a growth mindset, people believe that their most basic abilities can be developed through dedication and hard work - brains and talent are just the starting point. This view creates a love of learning and a resilience that is essential for great accomplishment.\u201d  \n\nLooking for affordable online therapy?

A fixed mindset can keep you stuck feeling depressed or anxious. In this video you\u2019re going to learn how to tell if you have a growth or a fixed mindset, how to develop a growth mindset in regards to mental health. And why having a growth mindset can completely change how you feel about your mental health. \nCarol Dweck, the author of Mindset (which this video is based off of) said \u201cIn a growth mindset, people believe that their most basic abilities can be developed through dedication and hard work - brains and talent are just the starting point. This view creates a love of learning and a resilience that is essential for great accomplishment.\u201d  \n\nLooking for affordable online therapy?

(Buy the full course with workbook here: https://courses.therapynutshell.com). I can't believe it's over! By this point you\u2019ve learned over 30 skills that you can use to process through your emotions. \nBut the goal of this course isn\u2019t just to feel better, it\u2019s also to get better at feeling. To get good at having emotions, working through them and then making choices that lead to a rich and fulfilling life. \n\nWhen we take a step back and look at the process of resolving emotions, we start with identifying the emotion, then move into slowing it down, accepting the emotion and exploring it, all of these steps are important. But the whole purpose of emotional regulation is to help us take helpful action. Action often helps us free up that stored \u2018movement\u2019 inside us. Look at the word \u201cemotion\u201d e-motion, the \u201cmot\u201d comes from Latin and means \u201cto move\u201d, the same root that is in words like motivation and motor, it is something that inspires movement. Our emotions, even the ones that can be considered \u201cnegative\u201d (or uncomfortable) can be powerful motivating forces to help us move and change. \n\nLooking for affordable online therapy?

(Buy the full course with workbook here: https://courses.therapynutshell.com). I can't believe it's over! By this point you\u2019ve learned over 30 skills that you can use to process through your emotions. \nBut the goal of this course isn\u2019t just to feel better, it\u2019s also to get better at feeling. To get good at having emotions, working through them and then making choices that lead to a rich and fulfilling life. \n\nWhen we take a step back and look at the process of resolving emotions, we start with identifying the emotion, then move into slowing it down, accepting the emotion and exploring it, all of these steps are important. But the whole purpose of emotional regulation is to help us take helpful action. Action often helps us free up that stored \u2018movement\u2019 inside us. Look at the word \u201cemotion\u201d e-motion, the \u201cmot\u201d comes from Latin and means \u201cto move\u201d, the same root that is in words like motivation and motor, it is something that inspires movement. Our emotions, even the ones that can be considered \u201cnegative\u201d (or uncomfortable) can be powerful motivating forces to help us move and change. \n\nLooking for affordable online therapy?

But if you\u2019ve watched a lot of my videos you also know that I make a ton of videos about growth and hope and change and lowering anxiety. \n\nSo it\u2019s fair that I often get asked how do I reconcile this idea of acceptance with change, for example this question from a student: \u201cI'm a bit confused about how doing exercises to regulate the nervous system fits in with the previous section where we were encouraged to be willing to 'feel' emotions. These exercises sort of feel like an attempt to get rid of negative emotions.\u201d\n\nThis is a great question and I think it\u2019s a really important question to carefully consider.  I think it is really easy to get mixed up when it comes to figuring out how to manage emotions.

You can learn to process through anxiety, to resolve it and change your relationship to it. Let me show you how.  In this video we\u2019ll use three examples to show you a step by step way to process anxiety. We\u2019re going to talk about:\n1- Bob, who has social anxiety- He feels anxious and uncomfortable around people he constantly worries about what he says and what other people are thinking about him. \n2- Jane who experiences general anxiety-She just feels anxious and jittery much of the day for no apparent reason. And\n3- Fred who has event anxiety- Fred is really anxious about an upcoming presentation that he has to give at school, it\u2019s a big part of his grade and really needs to get a good score. \nAnd we\u2019re going to use these three examples as a way to actually put into practice the emotion processing model, those in-depth skills that help you resolve anxiety instead of just cope with it.\n\nLooking for affordable online therapy?

In this video you're going to learn four skills to turn off this fear response, aka the fight/flight/freeze response, and restore a sense of calm in your body and mind. \nWhen we believe we are in danger, our body and mind create the fear response, the same physical anxiety reaction as if we were in actual physical danger. This is the fear response, aka the fight/flight/freeze response. This keeps us stuck in FFF response (NS hyperarousal). How we think about things and how we interpret our situation creates a sense of either calm or fear.\n\nLooking for affordable online therapy?

In this video you're going to learn four skills to turn off this fear response, aka the fight/flight/freeze response, and restore a sense of calm in your body and mind. \nWhen we believe we are in danger, our body and mind create the fear response, the same physical anxiety reaction as if we were in actual physical danger. This is the fear response, aka the fight/flight/freeze response. This keeps us stuck in FFF response (NS hyperarousal). How we think about things and how we interpret our situation creates a sense of either calm or fear.\n\nLooking for affordable online therapy?

                    "title": "Two Things You Can Do To Stop Ruminating",
                    "description": "The term ruminate means to run a thought over and over in your mind. This is the figurative definition. The literal definition refers to cows regurgitating their food to chew it over and over. \n\nRumination is not a diagnosis all to itself, we see it in depression and anxiety. Rumination causes people to get stuck in their thoughts and even feel stuck in the negativity of their condition. Typical negative depressive ruminations may be things like: why do I always get the short end of the stick? Why can\u2019t I be happy like everyone else?\n\nAnxious ruminations tend to be worrying about things that happened in the past like analyzing past situations and worrying about what kind of impression you left, or what did that person mean by that. At the time she said what she did, you didn\u2019t think that much of it, but when you get to the end of the day and start ruminating over the interaction, what the person said takes on a completely different meaning. And it\u2019s usually a negative meaning.\n\nIn both scenarios, it\u2019s repetitive, unhelpful, negative thinking. This is different from deconstructing a past situation so that you can process it and problem solve. In that case, analyzing the past is constructive and you\u2019re not stuck only thinking about the negative aspects of the situation.\n\nWhy does this happen?\nIt\u2019s thought to be related to overactivation of the default mode network in your brain. I talked about this in a video I did on mindfulness and depression. The gist of it is the default mode network is the area of the brain that control stimulus-independent thought. Said another way, the area of your brain that controls what you\u2019re thinking about when you\u2019re not actively focused on something. It\u2019s like background thought. Studies have shown that people are more unhappy when they spend a lot of time with their minds wandering. Functional MRI scans looking at brain activity show that the default mode network in your brain is more activated when you are ruminating.\n\nWhat do you do about this? \nTwo things. One is to spend more time being mindful. Mindfulness is the practice of being fully present in your current circumstance without judgment. If you bring your attention to what you\u2019re currently doing and how it is affecting all five of your senses, you now have dependent thought because you\u2019re actively paying attention to something. Your default mode network where you spend time ruminating is turned off. For more on mindfulness check out the mindfulness video. I also have a body scan audio download that goes along with that video.\n\nThe second thing you can do is develop an if/then action plan. The first part is creating a list of outward signs that you are ruminating. This is what you\u2019re feeling at the time. Since you can get lost in your head, you may not always be aware of what you\u2019re feeling. Some outward signs are things like rocking, fidgeting, feeling your heart race or you may start to get a headache. Take note of your signs so you can easily recognize when you\u2019re in this state.\n\nThen you want to write plan for what you\u2019re going to do when you notice that you are ruminating. You want to turn to an activity that will distract you from the rumination. \n\nThese activities can be relaxing \u2013 like listening to a guided meditation or doing a craft, or putting entries into your gratitude journal.\n\nThen you want to form your if/then statements with these two pieces of information. You want to write this down to make it official. You don\u2019t want to keep it all in your head. After all you\u2019re trying to get out of your head.\n\nYou want to come up with as many if/then scenarios as you can. You definitely want to cover all of your rumination trigger signs. But for each sign, you may want to have 2 or three activities you will engage in so you can have some variety.\n\nMindfulness and Depression video\nhttps://youtu.be/6SAFvliImdU\n\nRelaxation Download\nhttp://markspsychiatry.com/how-to-stop-ruminating\n\nReference\nBerman MG, Peltier S, Nee DE, Kross E, Deldin PJ, Jonides J.

                        "title": "Two Things You Can Do To Stop Ruminating",
                        "description": "The term ruminate means to run a thought over and over in your mind. This is the figurative definition. The literal definition refers to cows regurgitating their food to chew it over and over. \n\nRumination is not a diagnosis all to itself, we see it in depression and anxiety. Rumination causes people to get stuck in their thoughts and even feel stuck in the negativity of their condition. Typical negative depressive ruminations may be things like: why do I always get the short end of the stick? Why can\u2019t I be happy like everyone else?\n\nAnxious ruminations tend to be worrying about things that happened in the past like analyzing past situations and worrying about what kind of impression you left, or what did that person mean by that. At the time she said what she did, you didn\u2019t think that much of it, but when you get to the end of the day and start ruminating over the interaction, what the person said takes on a completely different meaning. And it\u2019s usually a negative meaning.\n\nIn both scenarios, it\u2019s repetitive, unhelpful, negative thinking. This is different from deconstructing a past situation so that you can process it and problem solve. In that case, analyzing the past is constructive and you\u2019re not stuck only thinking about the negative aspects of the situation.\n\nWhy does this happen?\nIt\u2019s thought to be related to overactivation of the default mode network in your brain. I talked about this in a video I did on mindfulness and depression. The gist of it is the default mode network is the area of the brain that control stimulus-independent thought. Said another way, the area of your brain that controls what you\u2019re thinking about when you\u2019re not actively focused on something. It\u2019s like background thought. Studies have shown that people are more unhappy when they spend a lot of time with their minds wandering. Functional MRI scans looking at brain activity show that the default mode network in your brain is more activated when you are ruminating.\n\nWhat do you do about this? \nTwo things. One is to spend more time being mindful. Mindfulness is the practice of being fully present in your current circumstance without judgment. If you bring your attention to what you\u2019re currently doing and how it is affecting all five of your senses, you now have dependent thought because you\u2019re actively paying attention to something. Your default mode network where you spend time ruminating is turned off. For more on mindfulness check out the mindfulness video. I also have a body scan audio download that goes along with that video.\n\nThe second thing you can do is develop an if/then action plan. The first part is creating a list of outward signs that you are ruminating. This is what you\u2019re feeling at the time. Since you can get lost in your head, you may not always be aware of what you\u2019re feeling. Some outward signs are things like rocking, fidgeting, feeling your heart race or you may start to get a headache. Take note of your signs so you can easily recognize when you\u2019re in this state.\n\nThen you want to write plan for what you\u2019re going to do when you notice that you are ruminating. You want to turn to an activity that will distract you from the rumination. \n\nThese activities can be relaxing \u2013 like listening to a guided meditation or doing a craft, or putting entries into your gratitude journal.\n\nThen you want to form your if/then statements with these two pieces of information. You want to write this down to make it official. You don\u2019t want to keep it all in your head. After all you\u2019re trying to get out of your head.\n\nYou want to come up with as many if/then scenarios as you can. You definitely want to cover all of your rumination trigger signs. But for each sign, you may want to have 2 or three activities you will engage in so you can have some variety.\n\nMindfulness and Depression video\nhttps://youtu.be/6SAFvliImdU\n\nRelaxation Download\nhttp://markspsychiatry.com/how-to-stop-ruminating\n\nReference\nBerman MG, Peltier S, Nee DE, Kross E, Deldin PJ, Jonides J.

The emotions are real reactions to thoughts that are usually distorted in some way. Here\u2019s what you can do to break the cycle of ruminating over these thoughts and spiraling into an emotional black hole.\n\nFirst - Defuse the intensity of experience by using visualizations to pull you out of the moment so you can evaluate your thoughts. This breaks the negative momentum and gives you a chance to look more objectively at what\u2019s going on. \nSecond - use coping statements and grounding exercises to distract yourself from the thoughts and emotions. \n\nThe techniques/exercises I discuss in this video:\nVisualizations using the Character Technique, Disposal, Mind attribution\nCoping Statements\nGrounding Exercises\nRubber Band Distraction\nDrinking mindfully\nMindful breathing\nColors in the environment\n\nWANT TO START IN THERAPY? Here\u2019s a convenient and affordable option\nhttps://Betterhelp.com/drmarks \nFor a monthly fee, you get a REAL licensed therapist with whom you can meet weekly by phone, video or chat.

                    "description": "There\u2019s a concept in psychoanalytic theory called the corrective emotional experience. The classical definition of the corrective emotional experience is that it\u2019s a therapeutic process where the therapist helps you experience what was previously a painful relationship by making it a healing relationship. The therapist does this by reenacting certain dynamics with you and then reacts to you in a way that is positive and different from what you expect. And when you continue to get these responses that are positive and opposite of what you\u2019re used to, you began to heal by having an experience in real time that corrects what happened in the past. \n\nThat\u2019s the classic way this concept was defined and used with therapists who practice psychoanalytic therapy. But there\u2019s been an evolution in how the term is conceptualized. It can be thought of more broadly as an explanation for why you seem to be attracted to the same kind of negative relationship \u2013 this can even bleed into your close friendships. \n\nThis term comes from object-relations theory where people are called objects. And it\u2019s about how you relate to central objects in your life like your mother. The idea of the corrective emotional experience CAN refer to the process of a person seeking a negative object or relationship, for the purpose of reenacting the negative dynamic in a way that allows you to correct the original negative experience.\n\nIn this video I give you three examples to illustrate how this works.\n\nWhat can you do about this? \nYou start with examining the negative relationships and asking the following questions. \nIn these relationships what does the person do to you that makes you feel bad about yourself? It could be what they don't do, like she never complements you.  \nThen look at your relationship with your parents or your close caretaker. Which parent has a stronger impact on you? \nWho are you closest to? \nWhich one who did you have a bad relationship with and why? If it was both, which was worse?\n\nThis video is part of my series of videos related to mastering your relationships. This series of videos cover love relationships, friendships and casual relationships at work and school. You can watch playlist here https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLazcP3-djRZ0PiMMFUtK0P0Z3ocsgTcDA and save it for when I upload new videos to it.\n\n\nDisclaimer: All of the information on this channel is for educational purposes and not intended to be specific/personal medical advice from me to you. Watching the videos or getting answers to comments/question, does not establish a doctor-patient relationship. If you have your own doctor, perhaps these videos can help prepare you for your discussion with your doctor.\n\nI upload every Wednesday at 9am, and sometimes have extra videos in between.

                        "description": "There\u2019s a concept in psychoanalytic theory called the corrective emotional experience. The classical definition of the corrective emotional experience is that it\u2019s a therapeutic process where the therapist helps you experience what was previously a painful relationship by making it a healing relationship. The therapist does this by reenacting certain dynamics with you and then reacts to you in a way that is positive and different from what you expect. And when you continue to get these responses that are positive and opposite of what you\u2019re used to, you began to heal by having an experience in real time that corrects what happened in the past. \n\nThat\u2019s the classic way this concept was defined and used with therapists who practice psychoanalytic therapy. But there\u2019s been an evolution in how the term is conceptualized. It can be thought of more broadly as an explanation for why you seem to be attracted to the same kind of negative relationship \u2013 this can even bleed into your close friendships. \n\nThis term comes from object-relations theory where people are called objects. And it\u2019s about how you relate to central objects in your life like your mother. The idea of the corrective emotional experience CAN refer to the process of a person seeking a negative object or relationship, for the purpose of reenacting the negative dynamic in a way that allows you to correct the original negative experience.\n\nIn this video I give you three examples to illustrate how this works.\n\nWhat can you do about this? \nYou start with examining the negative relationships and asking the following questions. \nIn these relationships what does the person do to you that makes you feel bad about yourself? It could be what they don't do, like she never complements you.  \nThen look at your relationship with your parents or your close caretaker. Which parent has a stronger impact on you? \nWho are you closest to? \nWhich one who did you have a bad relationship with and why? If it was both, which was worse?\n\nThis video is part of my series of videos related to mastering your relationships. This series of videos cover love relationships, friendships and casual relationships at work and school. You can watch playlist here https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLazcP3-djRZ0PiMMFUtK0P0Z3ocsgTcDA and save it for when I upload new videos to it.\n\n\nDisclaimer: All of the information on this channel is for educational purposes and not intended to be specific/personal medical advice from me to you. Watching the videos or getting answers to comments/question, does not establish a doctor-patient relationship. If you have your own doctor, perhaps these videos can help prepare you for your discussion with your doctor.\n\nI upload every Wednesday at 9am, and sometimes have extra videos in between.

I give you 10 red flags to recognize a toxic relationship and 4 ways to detox the relationship.\n\nHere is a list of some behaviors that I believe should be considered red flags, that you do NOT ignore or think they\u2019ll just go away with time. They\u2019re also not transient behaviors that you see when someone is going through a bad patch.  These are behaviors or attitudes that persist over time regardless of the circumstances.\n\n1. Chronic anger\n2. Chronic sarcasm. \n3. Disparaging humor. \n4. Having a Punitive mindset.  o\n5. Controlling nature  \n6. Excessive insecurity \n7. Extremely opinionated\n8. The Manipulator.\n9. Predominate self-centeredness\n10.  Need to be on the offense.  \n\nIf you grew up around someone who did some of these things, you may find yourself being attracted to similar people even though you don't like their behavior. Even objectionable behavior can feel familiar and comfortable at some level.\n\nI upload every Wednesday at 9am, and sometimes have extra videos in between.

I give you 10 red flags to recognize a toxic relationship and 4 ways to detox the relationship.\n\nHere is a list of some behaviors that I believe should be considered red flags, that you do NOT ignore or think they\u2019ll just go away with time. They\u2019re also not transient behaviors that you see when someone is going through a bad patch.  These are behaviors or attitudes that persist over time regardless of the circumstances.\n\n1. Chronic anger\n2. Chronic sarcasm. \n3. Disparaging humor. \n4. Having a Punitive mindset.  o\n5. Controlling nature  \n6. Excessive insecurity \n7. Extremely opinionated\n8. The Manipulator.\n9. Predominate self-centeredness\n10.  Need to be on the offense.  \n\nIf you grew up around someone who did some of these things, you may find yourself being attracted to similar people even though you don't like their behavior. Even objectionable behavior can feel familiar and comfortable at some level.\n\nI upload every Wednesday at 9am, and sometimes have extra videos in between.

So if you\u2019re a budding adventurer you can join Finn & Jake by subscribing to the Adventure Time official YouTube channel now for regular updates!\n\nAdventure Time on the Cartoon Network website: http://www.cartoonnetwork.co.uk/\n\nAdventure Time Facebook page:https://www.facebook.com/adventuretime\n\nAdventure Time is about two close friends: Jake, a wise old dog with a big kind heart, and Finn, a silly kid who wants more than anything else to become a great hero. These two dudes are all they have in the ways of family. They depend and lean on each other through thick and thin, they trust one another with secrets and look to each other for advice when problems get out of hand. More important than any of that, Finn and Jake crack each other up by acting like idiots and telling ridiculous jokes as they traverse their way across a massive and treacherous island seeking heart\u00ad pounding adventure to pass the time.\n\nAt first glance you probably wouldn't know it, but Finn is a mighty hero. It's true, he's passionate about heroism. For a twelve-year-old kid, saving princesses and battling sinister wizards, it's quite an admirable hobby. Finn doesn't know why he's compelled to protect good from evil; it's just something he understands is necessary. It could be in his blood, maybe his parents were noble do gooders like him. Maybe they're royal cosmic cowboys fighting intergalactic outlaws in space, maybe they're the presidents of righteous Dinosaur Knights. Finn doesn't know his own mysterious origin. Even though he doesn't have the skills to win the battle, Finn is a furious little booger when it comes to opposing evil. Finn isn't very muscley, he's kinda small with a big fat head and little feet. What Finn does have is a strong moral backbone, a clear set of values and a lot of nerve! That's what makes him a hero. Standing strong in the face of adversity. Throwing caution to the wind in order to protect the ones he loves. Finn takes pleasure in all the standard kid business like making up songs and crashing monster dance parties. And when evil isn't running amok? Finn is happy to spend those carefree moments jumping on rocks, rolling around in the grass or exploring his favorite adventure spots.\n\nJake is like an older brother or cool uncle to Finn. Sure, they're both pretty young but, in dog years, Jake's 28-years-old. Jake is very jokey, everything can be poked fun at until it gets serious. And when it's serious, like when Finn in feeling low or sad, Jake is good at listening and knowing the most thoughtful thing to say.\n \nCome on get ready to travel to very distant lands with Jake the dog and Finn the human the fun will never end. It\u2019s adventure time!\n\n\u25ba  Click to watch more Adventure Time: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCR2EiOqqsU\n\n\u25ba  Click to watch the best of Finn the Human: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Osp-QrvLGqY\n\n\u25ba  Click to watch all Adventure Time Videos: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLNRIpq3d76AzQ-kyDf34xx1nK5ZIBYxPi\n\n#adventuretime #adventuretimenewepisodes #adventuretimedistantlands #finnandjake #distantlands #comealongwithme #candykingdom #grasslands #princessbubblegum #marceline #iceking #icekingdom #snowgolem #thelich #adventuretimesongs",

These two dudes are all they have in the ways of family. They depend and lean on each other through thick and thin, they trust one another with secrets and look to each other for advice when problems get out of hand. More important than any of that, Finn and Jake crack each other up by acting like idiots and telling ridiculous jokes as they traverse their way across a massive and treacherous island seeking heart\u00ad pounding adventure to pass the time.\n\nAt first glance you probably wouldn't know it, but Finn is a mighty hero. It's true, he's passionate about heroism. For a twelve-year-old kid, saving princesses and battling sinister wizards, it's quite an admirable hobby. Finn doesn't know why he's compelled to protect good from evil; it's just something he understands is necessary. It could be in his blood, maybe his parents were noble do gooders like him. Maybe they're royal cosmic cowboys fighting intergalactic outlaws in space, maybe they're the presidents of righteous Dinosaur Knights. Finn doesn't know his own mysterious origin. Even though he doesn't have the skills to win the battle, Finn is a furious little booger when it comes to opposing evil. Finn isn't very muscley, he's kinda small with a big fat head and little feet. What Finn does have is a strong moral backbone, a clear set of values and a lot of nerve! That's what makes him a hero. Standing strong in the face of adversity. Throwing caution to the wind in order to protect the ones he loves. Finn takes pleasure in all the standard kid business like making up songs and crashing monster dance parties. And when evil isn't running amok? Finn is happy to spend those carefree moments jumping on rocks, rolling around in the grass or exploring his favorite adventure spots.\n\nJake is like an older brother or cool uncle to Finn. Sure, they're both pretty young but, in dog years, Jake's 28-years-old. Jake is very jokey, everything can be poked fun at until it gets serious. And when it's serious, like when Finn in feeling low or sad, Jake is good at listening and knowing the most thoughtful thing to say.\n \nCome on get ready to travel to very distant lands with Jake the dog and Finn the human the fun will never end.

Explore funny clips, fun facts and trivia about your favourite kingdoms and characters from the Land of Ooo. There\u2019s a ton of laugh out loud moments, game-play footage and special content you won\u2019t find anywhere else. It\u2019s mathematical! So if you\u2019re a budding adventurer you can join Finn & Jake by subscribing to the Adventure Time official YouTube channel now for regular updates!\n\nAdventure Time on the Cartoon Network website: http://www.cartoonnetwork.co.uk/\n\nAdventure Time Facebook page:https://www.facebook.com/adventuretime\n\nAdventure Time is about two close friends: Jake, a wise old dog with a big kind heart, and Finn, a silly kid who wants more than anything else to become a great hero. These two dudes are all they have in the ways of family. They depend and lean on each other through thick and thin, they trust one another with secrets and look to each other for advice when problems get out of hand. More important than any of that, Finn and Jake crack each other up by acting like idiots and telling ridiculous jokes as they traverse their way across a massive and treacherous island seeking heart\u00ad pounding adventure to pass the time.\n\nAt first glance you probably wouldn't know it, but Finn is a mighty hero. It's true, he's passionate about heroism. For a twelve-year-old kid, saving princesses and battling sinister wizards, it's quite an admirable hobby. Finn doesn't know why he's compelled to protect good from evil; it's just something he understands is necessary. It could be in his blood, maybe his parents were noble do gooders like him. Maybe they're royal cosmic cowboys fighting intergalactic outlaws in space, maybe they're the presidents of righteous Dinosaur Knights. Finn doesn't know his own mysterious origin. Even though he doesn't have the skills to win the battle, Finn is a furious little booger when it comes to opposing evil. Finn isn't very muscley, he's kinda small with a big fat head and little feet. What Finn does have is a strong moral backbone, a clear set of values and a lot of nerve! That's what makes him a hero. Standing strong in the face of adversity. Throwing caution to the wind in order to protect the ones he loves. Finn takes pleasure in all the standard kid business like making up songs and crashing monster dance parties. And when evil isn't running amok? Finn is happy to spend those carefree moments jumping on rocks, rolling around in the grass or exploring his favorite adventure spots.\n\nJake is like an older brother or cool uncle to Finn. Sure, they're both pretty young but, in dog years, Jake's 28-years-old. Jake is very jokey, everything can be poked fun at until it gets serious. And when it's serious, like when Finn in feeling low or sad, Jake is good at listening and knowing the most thoughtful thing to say.\n \nCome on get ready to travel to very distant lands with Jake the dog and Finn the human the fun will never end.

So if you\u2019re a budding adventurer you can join Finn & Jake by subscribing to the Adventure Time official YouTube channel now for regular updates!\n\nAdventure Time on the Cartoon Network website: http://www.cartoonnetwork.co.uk/\n\nAdventure Time Facebook page:https://www.facebook.com/adventuretime\n\nAdventure Time is about two close friends: Jake, a wise old dog with a big kind heart, and Finn, a silly kid who wants more than anything else to become a great hero. These two dudes are all they have in the ways of family. They depend and lean on each other through thick and thin, they trust one another with secrets and look to each other for advice when problems get out of hand. More important than any of that, Finn and Jake crack each other up by acting like idiots and telling ridiculous jokes as they traverse their way across a massive and treacherous island seeking heart\u00ad pounding adventure to pass the time.\n\nAt first glance you probably wouldn't know it, but Finn is a mighty hero. It's true, he's passionate about heroism. For a twelve-year-old kid, saving princesses and battling sinister wizards, it's quite an admirable hobby. Finn doesn't know why he's compelled to protect good from evil; it's just something he understands is necessary. It could be in his blood, maybe his parents were noble do gooders like him. Maybe they're royal cosmic cowboys fighting intergalactic outlaws in space, maybe they're the presidents of righteous Dinosaur Knights. Finn doesn't know his own mysterious origin. Even though he doesn't have the skills to win the battle, Finn is a furious little booger when it comes to opposing evil. Finn isn't very muscley, he's kinda small with a big fat head and little feet. What Finn does have is a strong moral backbone, a clear set of values and a lot of nerve! That's what makes him a hero. Standing strong in the face of adversity. Throwing caution to the wind in order to protect the ones he loves. Finn takes pleasure in all the standard kid business like making up songs and crashing monster dance parties. And when evil isn't running amok? Finn is happy to spend those carefree moments jumping on rocks, rolling around in the grass or exploring his favorite adventure spots.\n\nJake is like an older brother or cool uncle to Finn. Sure, they're both pretty young but, in dog years, Jake's 28-years-old. Jake is very jokey, everything can be poked fun at until it gets serious. And when it's serious, like when Finn in feeling low or sad, Jake is good at listening and knowing the most thoughtful thing to say.\n \nCome on get ready to travel to very distant lands with Jake the dog and Finn the human the fun will never end.
