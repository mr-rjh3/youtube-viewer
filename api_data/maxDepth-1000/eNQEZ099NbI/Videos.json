What starts with some fantasy vacation booking ends with Bert developing some wild ideas about being the mayor of a small French town. Tom's been a real true crime kick lately and has prepared a buffet of famous death row last meals from a collection of very cool guys and one gal. Bert and Tom taste test and give their two cents on each meal, plus get to know the crime and type of person behind each curated dish. They also talk about some revenge movie classics. Hope you're hungry!\n\nhttps://tomsegura.com/tour\nhttps://www.bertbertbert.com/tour\nhttps://store.ymhstudios.com\n\n2 Bears, 1 Cave Ep. 244\n\nYouTube Chapters  \n00:00:00 - Intro\n00:01:01 - European Styles \n00:04:51 - Speaking New Languages \n00:08:55 - Taking Over France \n00:17:14 - French Towns \n00:22:43 - Death Row Last Meals \n00:28:48 - John Spekelenk/Sandwich Guy \n00:37:13 - Aileen Wuornos/John Wayne Gacy \n00:45:13 - Christopher Eugene Brooks/William Gary Sallie \n00:53:56 - Timothy McVeigh \n00:58:33 - Ted Kaczynski Related To John Krasinski?\n01:02:51 - James Edward Smith/Stephen Wayne Anderson \n01:07:14 - The Last Last Meal\n01:13:07 - Punishment Fits The Crime\n01:16:54 - Revenge Movies"

According to Rolling Stone he would describe his father as and i quote \u201cstony coldness, typical of a Seventies man,\u201d, while mother was and i quote full of love, sweetness, and tenderness, and the total opposite of my dad.\u201d His mother encouraged Taylor to become a musician.\n\n His family would relocate to Laguna beach when he was 5 years old. Hawkins would tell the BBC that at the age of 10 he had a neighbour who had an old drum kit and a few beat up guitars and by this point in his life he didn\u2019t excel at anything including academics and sports. Hawkins would admit that he initially wanted to play guitar but it seemed like too much work to him and his neighbour encouraged him to try the drums. After observing Hawkins play he would tell him and i quote \u201cyou\u2019re a drummer.\u2019\n\nIn December of 1995 Grohl would meet hawkins for the first time at the KROQ almost acoustic christmas concert where both foo fighters and alanis morisette were on the bill.

According to Rolling Stone he would describe his father as and i quote \u201cstony coldness, typical of a Seventies man,\u201d, while mother was and i quote full of love, sweetness, and tenderness, and the total opposite of my dad.\u201d His mother encouraged Taylor to become a musician.\n\n His family would relocate to Laguna beach when he was 5 years old. Hawkins would tell the BBC that at the age of 10 he had a neighbour who had an old drum kit and a few beat up guitars and by this point in his life he didn\u2019t excel at anything including academics and sports. Hawkins would admit that he initially wanted to play guitar but it seemed like too much work to him and his neighbour encouraged him to try the drums. After observing Hawkins play he would tell him and i quote \u201cyou\u2019re a drummer.\u2019\n\nIn December of 1995 Grohl would meet hawkins for the first time at the KROQ almost acoustic christmas concert where both foo fighters and alanis morisette were on the bill. Grohl would recall meeting hawkins for the first time saying \u2018we got along like brothers from the second we met. We were best friends from that moment with taylor hawkins adding in the book \u2018this is a call \u201ci was this little dork playing in this back up band and the first thing that struck me was that dave was really nice and fun to hang out with. I\u2019d met some other people from big bands musicians i\u2019d looked up to and when i met them the vibe was oh you\u2019re not important. Hawkins who was a huge fan of nirvana and foo fighters first record noticed a camaraderie and likeness between himself and grohl as they smoked together and talked about their favourite music.  They would reconnect the summer of 1996 when they played some shows together in europe.Hawkins would admit that alanis morissette predicted he would join foo fighters at the time telling the Daily Mirror \u201cWe met the Foo Fighters when I was still playing with her, and she said, 'Dave [Grohl]\u2019s gonna ask you to join them someday.'

I reminded him we weren\u2019t selling out stadiums like alanis and he said \u2018i don\u2019t care man i just want to be in a f***** rock band.

Perry had a whole freakish look of his own, like some skinny, bugged-out goth surfer in whore makeup with flailing dreadlocks. Eric was more traditional punk rock, and Stephen had this crazy Afro hair thing. I was kind of a hippie kid, a little \u201960s-influenced Deadhead gone heavy metal. But you throw us together and it was a patchwork quilt\u2014it doesn\u2019t look like it makes sense, but it keeps you warm.\nThe band for their part didn\u2019t really have a formula to writing songs with Navarro telling billboard Eric would sometimes have a bass line, and we\u2019d write off that. Perry would sometimes have a weird guitar part, and we\u2019d write off that. Sometimes Perry would just have lyrics and we\u2019d have to come up with something based on that. There were times when Stephen was setting up his drums and would be playing something and we\u2019d go, \u201cWow, what is that?\u201d And he\u2019s like, \u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d and they\u2019re like, \u201cKeep playing it.\u201d And there were times when I was tuning up and just kind of playing random chords and somebody in the room would say, \u201cWhat are those chords?\u201d And I would say, \u201cI don\u2019t really know,\u201d and I\u2019d have to spend a half an hour trying to remember what they were. That\u2019s how we wrote songs.\nMonday through Friday the band continued to rehearse at the infamous Wilton House in the garage out back. They\u2019d share the rehearsal space with another band named Lions and Ghost Navarro would recall to Billbaord I would liken it to a miniature musical Warhol Factory kind of environment. Any time you\u2019d walk in the front door, you had no idea who you were going to run into, who you were gonna see. There were a lot of drugs happening. There was a lot of darkness. There was a lot of laughter. I\u2019ve spent some of my best nights in that house \u2014 and some of my worst nights in that house.\nThe band would gig around what Perry refers to as and i quote  \u201cthe underground Los Angeles\u201d \u2013 a mixture of of junkies, artists, bohemian types and. The later of which the band counted themselves part of as well. \nDrugs aside Farrell made it his mission to change the rock landscape which he deemed boring by the time Jane\u2019s Addiciton sprouted up telling Loudersound \u201cRock\u2019n\u2019roll had been around for thirty years,\u201d s. \u201cIt was almost impossible to come up with a new sound, a new way. But I had to have it. We had to do it. And what happened was, I saw what I didn\u2019t like.\u201d\nOne of those early songs written by the band that would get them record label attention was an acoustic number called Jane Says, which was inspired by the same Jane who inspired the group\u2019s name.. Eric Avery would tell Spin Sometimes we\u2019d do acoustic jams on the porch at the Wilton House.

Perry had a whole freakish look of his own, like some skinny, bugged-out goth surfer in whore makeup with flailing dreadlocks. Eric was more traditional punk rock, and Stephen had this crazy Afro hair thing. I was kind of a hippie kid, a little \u201960s-influenced Deadhead gone heavy metal. But you throw us together and it was a patchwork quilt\u2014it doesn\u2019t look like it makes sense, but it keeps you warm.\nThe band for their part didn\u2019t really have a formula to writing songs with Navarro telling billboard Eric would sometimes have a bass line, and we\u2019d write off that. Perry would sometimes have a weird guitar part, and we\u2019d write off that. Sometimes Perry would just have lyrics and we\u2019d have to come up with something based on that. There were times when Stephen was setting up his drums and would be playing something and we\u2019d go, \u201cWow, what is that?\u201d And he\u2019s like, \u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d and they\u2019re like, \u201cKeep playing it.\u201d And there were times when I was tuning up and just kind of playing random chords and somebody in the room would say, \u201cWhat are those chords?\u201d And I would say, \u201cI don\u2019t really know,\u201d and I\u2019d have to spend a half an hour trying to remember what they were. That\u2019s how we wrote songs.\nMonday through Friday the band continued to rehearse at the infamous Wilton House in the garage out back. They\u2019d share the rehearsal space with another band named Lions and Ghost Navarro would recall to Billbaord I would liken it to a miniature musical Warhol Factory kind of environment. Any time you\u2019d walk in the front door, you had no idea who you were going to run into, who you were gonna see. There were a lot of drugs happening. There was a lot of darkness. There was a lot of laughter. I\u2019ve spent some of my best nights in that house \u2014 and some of my worst nights in that house.\nThe band would gig around what Perry refers to as and i quote  \u201cthe underground Los Angeles\u201d \u2013 a mixture of of junkies, artists, bohemian types and. The later of which the band counted themselves part of as well. \nDrugs aside Farrell made it his mission to change the rock landscape which he deemed boring by the time Jane\u2019s Addiciton sprouted up telling Loudersound \u201cRock\u2019n\u2019roll had been around for thirty years,\u201d s. \u201cIt was almost impossible to come up with a new sound, a new way. But I had to have it. We had to do it. And what happened was, I saw what I didn\u2019t like.\u201d\nOne of those early songs written by the band that would get them record label attention was an acoustic number called Jane Says, which was inspired by the same Jane who inspired the group\u2019s name.. Eric Avery would tell Spin Sometimes we\u2019d do acoustic jams on the porch at the Wilton House. I\u2019ll never forget when Jane asked us if we\u2019d play a sad song for her, and I had to shake my head and say, \u201cJane, we just got through playing \u2018Jane Says,\u2019 one of the saddest songs in the world.\u201d References to drugs were littered throughout the song.\n In 1985 a local record label and management company named Triple X had sprouted up and soon had Jane\u2019s Addiction on their radars.

READ OUR DISCLAIMER https://rockandrolltruestories.com/youtube-disclaimer/\n\nIt was in the spring of 1992 STP would relocate to the san fernando valley with producer Brendan o\u2019 brien who had already worked with the black crowes, chili peppers and pearl jam. Drummer Eric Kretz would recall the energy the band brought to the recording of their debut record telling Songfacts\nThere was enthusiasm and excitement and everyone was in the room and participating creatively, artistically,\"It's the most fun time to be in a band when everyone has the same ideas and everyone has the same goals. Core would be recorded in just three weeks. \nOnce the band was about to submit the album to their label, they soon discovered an old Chicago blues musician already had the name mighty joe young.  The musician had been putting out albums since the 70\u2019s on a local indie label,  went on hiatus and decided to come back. So the band, had to come up with a new name.. It would be a car lubricant called STP Oil Treatment that inspired Mighty Joe Young\u2019s new name. Weiland had a fascination with it since he was a kid.. Scott suggested the band come up with a new name using the letters STP. One early name they had was Shirley Temple\u2019s Private (they had a more lude term for the letter P than what I\u2019m saying, but i\u2019ll leave it to your imagineation). They eventually went with Stone Temple Pilots. \nCore would be released in September of 1992, during the peak of the grunge movement. The album\u2019s first single Sex Type Thing, was a massive hit on MTV, first landing on the network\u2019s buzz bin program, which featured up and coming bands and songs. It soon was played amongst groups like Alice in Chains, Pearl Jam, and Nirvana. The song, while embraced by MTV, got a good amount of attention on alternative radio peaking at number 23, but modern rock radio didn\u2019t really embrace it. Dean would admit the riff for sex type thing was inspired by the Led Zeppelin tune in the light. The song garnered a lot of controversy, While the band were adamant in the press that they were pro-women, the media took one look at the lyrics and made up their own minds. If you read any press interview with the band during the promotion for Core, Sex Type THing\u2019s meaning comes up again and again. For Scott, the irony of the song was lost on everyone. Here\u2019s the frontman explaining to mtv what the lyrics were about.\nIt would be the album\u2019s second single, Plush that  catapulted Stone Temple Pilots into the stratosphere. Plush topped the  mainstream rock chart and alo appeared on the pop charts peaking at number 18.  Any of you guys remember the Grand Theft Auto San Andreas radio station radio X? The song was written by Robert in 1989 with him telling Rolling Stone \u201cAnd when I played it for Scott,\u201d, \u201che didn\u2019t like it. He said, \u2018It sounds too much like Boston.'\u201d Kind of funny, considering the song was often compared to sounding like a pearl jam song. Even at live shows, Scott jokingly introduced the song to audiences as being a song Pearl Jam wrote for them. \nPlush\u2019s popularity only increased when the band performed an acoustic version for MTV\u2019s Headbangers Ball program. That performance almost never happened because of a feud between MTV and STP. I\u2019ll talk a little later about that. Plush\u2019s lyrics were loosely inspired by a story the members read about a young woman from San Diego who went missing and was later discovered to be have been murdered. Scott would also reveal on VH1\u2019s story tellers that the song\u2019s lyrics deal with a lost obsessive relationship. \nOne of my personal favourites off the album, would be the third single Wicked Garden, would peak at number 11 on the mainstream rock chart.  And the album\u2019s final single the melancholy tune Creep would peak at number 2 on the charts and would deal with alienation. I always remember the movie Black Hawk Down when Grimes finds out he is about to head out on the now infamous Oct 3rd raid. There were even a few songs including Dead and Bloated and Crackerman that were released as promotional singles, but they enver. However, b I still hear them on radio to this day and they are one of the band\u2019s more popular son",

Drummer Eric Kretz would recall the energy the band brought to the recording of their debut record telling Songfacts\nThere was enthusiasm and excitement and everyone was in the room and participating creatively, artistically,\"It's the most fun time to be in a band when everyone has the same ideas and everyone has the same goals. Core would be recorded in just three weeks. \nOnce the band was about to submit the album to their label, they soon discovered an old Chicago blues musician already had the name mighty joe young.  The musician had been putting out albums since the 70\u2019s on a local indie label,  went on hiatus and decided to come back. So the band, had to come up with a new name.. It would be a car lubricant called STP Oil Treatment that inspired Mighty Joe Young\u2019s new name. Weiland had a fascination with it since he was a kid.. Scott suggested the band come up with a new name using the letters STP. One early name they had was Shirley Temple\u2019s Private (they had a more lude term for the letter P than what I\u2019m saying, but i\u2019ll leave it to your imagineation). They eventually went with Stone Temple Pilots. \nCore would be released in September of 1992, during the peak of the grunge movement. The album\u2019s first single Sex Type Thing, was a massive hit on MTV, first landing on the network\u2019s buzz bin program, which featured up and coming bands and songs. It soon was played amongst groups like Alice in Chains, Pearl Jam, and Nirvana. The song, while embraced by MTV, got a good amount of attention on alternative radio peaking at number 23, but modern rock radio didn\u2019t really embrace it. Dean would admit the riff for sex type thing was inspired by the Led Zeppelin tune in the light. The song garnered a lot of controversy, While the band were adamant in the press that they were pro-women, the media took one look at the lyrics and made up their own minds. If you read any press interview with the band during the promotion for Core, Sex Type THing\u2019s meaning comes up again and again. For Scott, the irony of the song was lost on everyone. Here\u2019s the frontman explaining to mtv what the lyrics were about.\nIt would be the album\u2019s second single, Plush that  catapulted Stone Temple Pilots into the stratosphere. Plush topped the  mainstream rock chart and alo appeared on the pop charts peaking at number 18.  Any of you guys remember the Grand Theft Auto San Andreas radio station radio X? The song was written by Robert in 1989 with him telling Rolling Stone \u201cAnd when I played it for Scott,\u201d, \u201che didn\u2019t like it. He said, \u2018It sounds too much like Boston.'\u201d Kind of funny, considering the song was often compared to sounding like a pearl jam song. Even at live shows, Scott jokingly introduced the song to audiences as being a song Pearl Jam wrote for them. \nPlush\u2019s popularity only increased when the band performed an acoustic version for MTV\u2019s Headbangers Ball program. That performance almost never happened because of a feud between MTV and STP. I\u2019ll talk a little later about that. Plush\u2019s lyrics were loosely inspired by a story the members read about a young woman from San Diego who went missing and was later discovered to be have been murdered. Scott would also reveal on VH1\u2019s story tellers that the song\u2019s lyrics deal with a lost obsessive relationship. \nOne of my personal favourites off the album, would be the third single Wicked Garden, would peak at number 11 on the mainstream rock chart.  And the album\u2019s final single the melancholy tune Creep would peak at number 2 on the charts and would deal with alienation. I always remember the movie Black Hawk Down when Grimes finds out he is about to head out on the now infamous Oct 3rd raid. There were even a few songs including Dead and Bloated and Crackerman that were released as promotional singles, but they enver. However, b I still hear them on radio to this day and they are one of the band\u2019s more popular son"

Linkin Park over the next several years became inescapable if you listened to rock radio or watched MTV. What came next is truly amazing.  Linkin Park did something that so few bands could do, their popularity eclipsed trends in music and they soon ventured into uncharted territory, much to the chagrin of some of their fans. But sadly their nearly two decade run came to an abrupt end following the death of frontman Chester Bennington. Today, let\u2019s take a deep dive into the career of Linkin Park.\n\nLinkin Park\u2019s story begins with Rapper/vocalist/guitarist/keyboardist/producer Mike Shinoda. Shinoda would be born to a japanese father and a white mother with the musician telling Howard Stern that being mixed race resulted in him not really knowing where he belonged in school. His mother would encourage him by the age of 6 to take up piano lessons thinking it would look good on his college applications. In addition to music lessons Shinoda would tell the shock jock that he he spent a lot of his time as a young child painting and doing artwork with the idea that perhaps someday he\u2019d become an artist \n\nIt was by the time he became a teenager he soon started to get into the blues, jazz and hip hop. Shinoda by the mid 80\u2019s would be hugely influenced by Run-DMC\u2019s second record King of Rock and Beastie Boys' License to Ill as well as LL Cool J's Bad in addition to Public Enemy and NWA. It would be the collaborations and blending of rock and rap that gave Shinoda an idea of what he wanted to pursue musically telling Rolling Stone \u201cThe first show I went to was Anthrax and Public Enemy. They did \u2018Bring the Noise\u2019 together, and I was like, \u2018That\u2019s the most amazing thing I\u2019ve ever heard.\n\nWanting to follow in the footsteps of his music idols who sampled popular rock music in their songs he would ask his musical teacher to teach him how to do just that   recalling to to Rolling Stone. When I was about thirteen, I told my teacher, Eileen, I wanted to get more into playing jazz and blues and maybe hip-hop. She said she couldn't help me out with that because that wasn't her training. She said, \"Maybe you just wanna get a keyboard and start learning those things on your own.\" I thought that was really big of her to say, and definitely led to an important point in my life where I bought a keyboard. Then I got a sampler, started making beats and playing around with MIDI and digital-based music.\u201d \n\nShinoda would tell Stern that prior to Chester Bennington fronting Linkin Park the seeds of the band began with him and a childhood friend of his named Mark Wakefield who he first started making music with recalling to the shock jock  \u201cthe band was just originally me and Mark and i would mostly do all the rap stuff and he would do most of the rock stuff and then we\u2019d teach each other the other side. Mark also happened to be living next door to guitarist Brad Delson with Shinoda adding \u201cAlmost like a TV Sitcom they were next door neighbours and there windows were across from each other\u2026We\u2019d be in mark\u2019s room playing sega genesis and you\u2019d hear brad playing metallica on the guitar from the other window.\u201d Delson was also a schoolmate of Shinoda Agoura High School in southern california. The trio soon recruited a bandmate of Delson, drummer Rob Bourdon, who played with him in the band Relative Degree.\u201c Bourdon, got his start drumming in the third grade after his parents took him to an aerosmith concert. Fun fact . (Bourdon\u2019s mother, Patty, was a high school girlfriend of Aerosmith drummer Joey Kramer, who he credits with coming up with the band name. \n\n It was following high school Shinoda attended Pasadena\u2019s California\u2019s Art of College Design where he studied illustration.

Yet, when it came time for Dave Grohl to write his autobiography, the Storyteller, the production of this album was left out. Dave didn't shy away from other difficult tales like the end of Nirvana and the loss of Kurt Cobain, or the many almost dissolutions of the Foo Fighters, so why did he skip this one? Join me as I explain the Foo Fighters album best album, that went terribly wrong.\n\nIf you liked this video please be sure to like, subscribe, comment, and share with anyone who'd be interested!\n\nSpecial thanks to Sam L for providing the voice of Gil Norton \n(https://www.fiverr.com/samfiver5)\n\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/marcbutevil\n\nBtw, Nirvana, the Pretender, Krist Novoselic, Learn to Fly, Best of You, All My Life"

One of Kurt Cobain's final interviews before his tragic death, this WatchMojo Presents video From the MUCH Vaults is an incredible look into the man and artist that we present on the day that would have been his 50th birthday. This raw video from 1993 features 6 minutes of very rarely seen footage from the original interview that was not aired on television.  Nirvana's legacy still burns bright and their music continues to influence and inspire people to this day.  We hope that you enjoy this thoughtful and engaged interview with a man who meant so much to so many people.  \n\n00:07 1) What are your favourite books and have they influenced your songwriting? \n\n1:50 2) Is it hard write new material in a short timeframe after having had your entire life to the write the material for your first two albums?\n\n02:39 3) There are a lot of baby references in your songs: wombs, babies\u2019 breath; is this a huge part of your life\u2026?\n\n04:19 4) Do you think the old saying that you can\u2019t buy happiness is true?\n\n05:08 5) Now that you\u2019ve had so much success, so quickly and so surprisingly, as well as a baby, your marriage, etc., what excites you now?\n\n05:49 6) How do you personally cope with having private relationships being scrutinized publicly? \n\n09:04 7) Is it weird to suddenly have lawyers and people who do that stuff for you?\n\n10:40 8) Do you think being in the music industry for a long time makes you nutty?\n\n11:48 9) Have you ever had second thoughts about bringing a child into the world, despite being able to see the world for what it is?\n\n13:38 10) \u201cGrunge\u201d: where did the term come from?\n\n17:19 11) One of the interesting things about Nirvana that you don\u2019t talk about much is that you seem very concerned about sexism. How do you make people aware of that problem?\n\n21:21 12) We\u2019re doing a special on The Replacements, did they have any influence n you on as a songwriter or any of the music you did?\n\n23:58 13) Did you get to meet anyone that you would consider your musical hero?\n\n24:40 14) Tell me about the record you\u2019re doing with William Burroughs.\n\n25:50 15) One of the members of Nirvana said he was perturbed by your mainstream audience and wanted to just make music for your real fans...?\n\nOur Magazine!!

One of Kurt Cobain's final interviews before his tragic death, this WatchMojo Presents video From the MUCH Vaults is an incredible look into the man and artist that we present on the day that would have been his 50th birthday. This raw video from 1993 features 6 minutes of very rarely seen footage from the original interview that was not aired on television.  Nirvana's legacy still burns bright and their music continues to influence and inspire people to this day.  We hope that you enjoy this thoughtful and engaged interview with a man who meant so much to so many people.  \n\n00:07 1) What are your favourite books and have they influenced your songwriting? \n\n1:50 2) Is it hard write new material in a short timeframe after having had your entire life to the write the material for your first two albums?\n\n02:39 3) There are a lot of baby references in your songs: wombs, babies\u2019 breath; is this a huge part of your life\u2026?\n\n04:19 4) Do you think the old saying that you can\u2019t buy happiness is true?\n\n05:08 5) Now that you\u2019ve had so much success, so quickly and so surprisingly, as well as a baby, your marriage, etc., what excites you now?\n\n05:49 6) How do you personally cope with having private relationships being scrutinized publicly? \n\n09:04 7) Is it weird to suddenly have lawyers and people who do that stuff for you?\n\n10:40 8) Do you think being in the music industry for a long time makes you nutty?\n\n11:48 9) Have you ever had second thoughts about bringing a child into the world, despite being able to see the world for what it is?\n\n13:38 10) \u201cGrunge\u201d: where did the term come from?\n\n17:19 11) One of the interesting things about Nirvana that you don\u2019t talk about much is that you seem very concerned about sexism. How do you make people aware of that problem?\n\n21:21 12) We\u2019re doing a special on The Replacements, did they have any influence n you on as a songwriter or any of the music you did?\n\n23:58 13) Did you get to meet anyone that you would consider your musical hero?\n\n24:40 14) Tell me about the record you\u2019re doing with William Burroughs.\n\n25:50 15) One of the members of Nirvana said he was perturbed by your mainstream audience and wanted to just make music for your real fans...?\n\nOur Magazine!!

                    "description": "MESSAGE: Have you ones filmed or recorded a show with Eric Clapton, but since forgotten all about it? Please consider to share it now. Time is passing, and some unique recordings might already be lost forever. The goal of the Slowhand Archive Project is to ensure rare recordings and films with Eric Clapton, are unearthed and shared for free with fellow music fans, before they are lost forever. We will help digitize, remaster and share with respect for your work and efforts recording the show. If you have filmed or recorded a show with EC, please get in touch on this email address: contact[@]slowhandguide.com \n\nThis is a true global fan project, made by Eric Clapton fans for Eric Clapton fans. The videos have received a revolving text-logo in the lower right corner making life for bootleggers and dishonest copycats, as hard as possible. Enjoy!\n\nDate: 12 January 1987 \n\nVenue: \nRoyal Albert Hall\nLondon\nUnited Kingdom\n\nHere comes - just for you - the result of close to 6 months work with syncing Mikey Mike's original and complete 2 hours long handheld master film, with the available soundboard audio recording from the same night. Mike and I agree that the experience of watching this film in full color and excellent sound - is breathtaking! This film will time warp you 33 years back in time to Royal Albert Hall in a VIP box with Mike across the stage, and just in front of Eric Clapton, Mark Knopfler and Phil Collins. \n\nNotes from Mike: \nEric is clearly enjoying himself, playing with his musical peers here. Wonderful solos on 'Sheriff', 'Holy Mother', 'Cocaine', 'Let it Rain', 'Cocaine' & 'Layla'. An awe-inspiring 'Same Old Blues'-clocking in at an amazing 22 minutes. And a very animated Eric, prowling all over the stage, jumping up on the drummers dias-even encouraging Mark to get up and boogie as well-and dancing back-to-back with Nathan whilst playing. You've never seen Eric enjoy himself as much! The 1987 run of shows at the RAH were a taste of things to come in the following years, with Eric playing a series of nights (6) pretty much in succession. I wanted to film one for posterity so managed to buy a ticket for a Box directly opposite the stage. For years this version has been traded with the original video/audio sound which, frankly, was quite poor (Panasonic C-VHS-a bulky monster with a large camera and separate recording unit & with very limited zoom). But now, with the magic of modern software, an available soundboard recording and a patient genius doing the authoring, you have a copy of the master with clear colours and vibrant sound. This tour featured Nathan East on bass, Greg Phillinganes on keyboards and Mark Knopfler on 2nd guitar. For this and the preceding night, Phil Collins played on drums in addition to regular drummer Steve Ferrone (contrary to the mistaken notes about this on the Where's Eric website). Eric's series of long engagements at this wonderfully intimate venue, which became legendary, would continue until 1996. Enjoy!\n \nSet list:\n01. Crossroads\n02. White Room\n03. I Shot The Sheriff\n04. Hung Up On Your Love\n05. Wonderful Tonight\n06. Miss You\n07. Same Old Blues\n08. Tearing Us Apart\n09. Holy Mother \n10. Badge \n11. Let It Rain\n12. Cocaine\n13. Layla\n14. Money For Nothing* \n15. Sunshine Of Your Love\n\nLineup:\nEric Clapton \u2013 guitar / vocals\nMark Knopfler \u2013 guitar / vocals*\nGreg Phillinganes \u2013 keyboards\nNathan East \u2013 bass\nSteve Ferrone - drums\nPhil Collins \u2013 drums\n\nNotes about remastering: The soundboard audio is borrowed from Mid Valley's release \"Romantic Isolation 247/248\" supposedly again borrowed from the master soundboard recording, done for the record company by The Mobile Studio Unlimited (the famous mobile studio truck build by Rolling Stones). The by today's standard's very limited battery- and tape length, resulted in several breaks during the filming. Although the video quality for a handheld recording done 30+ years ago is surprisingly good, the tapes suffered from many small speed changes and glitches. The entire film has now been synced to the soundboard audio. Where the film lacked a few seconds for tape changes and the like, these have been replaced by still frames or film taken from another clip. These fixes are hopefully hard to spot, but most noticable during the break before and the first minute of Money For Nothing, where Mike had to change battery. Colors and contrast levels were slightly adjusted. The complete editing process started 6 months before the film was ready. \n\nEnjoy!",

It led Eric and George to write some of the greatest love songs of all time such as Layla, Something, and Wonderful Tonight. This video follows their relationships in the 1960s and 1970s and the music that came out of this time.\n\n//\n\nThis video took ages to make. I took a break from YouTube for a few months, but not intentionally, I just couldn't get anything to work. I think I was trying too hard. I initially started this video in October '22 but I had writer's block for ages. I kept trying to write the script but I wasn't getting anywhere. It just got worse and worse. In the end, I revisited the script in early '23 and was able to make a pretty good story out of it, I'm quite pleased with how this video turned out. I didn't want to make anyone in the story appear in a bad light, EC was one of my guitar heroes when I was younger. As I write this the video has 5.4k views, but I reckon it has the potential to get some more.\n\n18th May 2023",

It led Eric and George to write some of the greatest love songs of all time such as Layla, Something, and Wonderful Tonight. This video follows their relationships in the 1960s and 1970s and the music that came out of this time.\n\n//\n\nThis video took ages to make. I took a break from YouTube for a few months, but not intentionally, I just couldn't get anything to work. I think I was trying too hard. I initially started this video in October '22 but I had writer's block for ages. I kept trying to write the script but I wasn't getting anywhere. It just got worse and worse. In the end, I revisited the script in early '23 and was able to make a pretty good story out of it, I'm quite pleased with how this video turned out. I didn't want to make anyone in the story appear in a bad light, EC was one of my guitar heroes when I was younger. As I write this the video has 5.4k views, but I reckon it has the potential to get some more.\n\n18th May 2023"

                    "description": "'UGLY CHIC' - THE PRADA STORY\n\nMiuccia Prada is regarded as one of the most influential and enigmatic fashion designers of modern times. For nearly four decades she has displayed her penchant for setting trends and bucking the ideas of her fellow designers, the now 71-year-old together with her CEO partner Patrizio Bertelli has transformed was essentially a small family business into one of the world\u2019s most renowned multi billion dollar fashion houses.\n\nMiuccia Prada is a true iconoclast, and one who never ducked a challenge, under her auteur like direction Prada has blended the old and the new, the ugly and the sublime, the vulgar and the simple, to show off a smorgasbord of original and often unexpected ideas. No two collections have ever looked even vaguely the same, and it\u2019s obvious to any fashionista watching that each well thought-out garment detail has come from one great mind. And the irony of the Prada renaissance under Muiccia started in 1985 with a choice of an unassuming fabric for her bags. Miuccia could have followed the likes of Louis Vuitton by brandishing a leather design with multiple gaudy logos, but instead, Prada went in a completely unheard of direction: choosing a fabric and feel that screamed function rather than fashion.\n\nPocone\u2014a military-grade nylon that was used by Prada\u2019s grandfather to cover trunks\u2014 was the key to Miuccia Prada\u2019s success. It was the last thing that should have worked for a designer handbag, but work it did. Starting with a series of waterproof backpacks, Prada eventually moved onto totes, backpacks and more all including a small black triangle bearing the Prada logo.\n\nWithin months, the Pocone bags and backpacks were a global phenomenon, collected, worn and lusted over by the fashion cognoscenti the world over .\n\nThe Pocone nylon backpacks were unlike anything else on the market: minimalistic, clean and simple, with the appeal of functionality. The \u201cVela\u201d bags were born out of Prada\u2019s disdain for the bags of other luxury competitors, which she deemed too formal and traditional. The selling point was the material: industrial nylon, which Prada sourced from factories producing the light-weight, waterproof fabric for military parachutes. What resulted was a complete transformation of what it meant to produce luxury goods - Prada managed to create the most sought-after designer bag, using perhaps the least luxurious material. The nylon bags were a symbol of modernity - it allowed luxury to be subversive and go beyond the superficial. Luxury goods were no longer just a stuffy status symbol, they were also modern and signifiers of a new kind of thinking style setter.\n\nDirected and Produced by Paul G Roberts\nWritten by Zoe Dela Plana and Paul G Roberts\nNarrated by Annalisa Piccio\nDOP's Jake Bugeja and Rami Slayman\nEdited and Sound Design by Jake Bugeja\n\nAnother FASHION INDUSTRY BROADCAST feature\n\nfashionindustrybroadcast.com\ndesiregroupe.com\nstyleplanettv.com",

There\u2019s a lot to unpack here: how Prada became involved with fashion in the first place, connections to royal families, the brand almost ceasing to exist, the arrival of Miuccia Prada, the launch of her own label Miu Miu, as well as the hiring of the legendary Raf Simons. We\u2019ll be diving into all of these topics and much, much more - so I hope you enjoy.

There\u2019s a lot to unpack here: how Prada became involved with fashion in the first place, connections to royal families, the brand almost ceasing to exist, the arrival of Miuccia Prada, the launch of her own label Miu Miu, as well as the hiring of the legendary Raf Simons. We\u2019ll be diving into all of these topics and much, much more - so I hope you enjoy. This is the history of Prada.\n\nThreaducation Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/threaducation\u200b \nChannel Discord: https://discord.gg/5F27S9aHSn\nContact: threaducationinfo@gmail.com\n\nDisclaimer: The images and videos used in this video are not owned or created by Threaducation.

                    "description": "Howard Schultz joined Starbucks in 1982 when there were four stores open in Seattle. Over the following three decades, he created one of the world\u2019s most iconic brands, leading the company\u2019s expansion to 28,000 stores in 78 countries.\n\nIn this intimate fireside chat, Conservation International CEO M. Sanjayan talks to Schultz about his childhood in public housing, his socially-minded corporate leadership, his legacy of achieving profitability without sacrificing integrity, and his grand plan for America.\n\nInterested in attending Summit events?

Where are the goal posts? How can you REALLY measure your progress and objectively KNOW if you\u2019re on track?\n\nThe secret is\u2026 you have to have a METHOD that you\u2019re following. \n\nWITH a method, drumming growth is inevitable, you become unstoppable, and you master the drums.\n\n(Put above sentence on screen, then below sentence separately immediately afterward)\n\nWITHOUT a method, you\u2019re scattered, failing to grow over the long term, and you most likely end up giving up without ever realizing your dream. \n\nBut this won\u2019t be you, because you\u2019re going to take action on the method I\u2019m teaching you today, which shows you exactly how to get from Beginner to ready-to-play-with-a-band (and beyond) in 6 steps.

Where are the goal posts? How can you REALLY measure your progress and objectively KNOW if you\u2019re on track?\n\nThe secret is\u2026 you have to have a METHOD that you\u2019re following. \n\nWITH a method, drumming growth is inevitable, you become unstoppable, and you master the drums.\n\n(Put above sentence on screen, then below sentence separately immediately afterward)\n\nWITHOUT a method, you\u2019re scattered, failing to grow over the long term, and you most likely end up giving up without ever realizing your dream. \n\nBut this won\u2019t be you, because you\u2019re going to take action on the method I\u2019m teaching you today, which shows you exactly how to get from Beginner to ready-to-play-with-a-band (and beyond) in 6 steps. YOU CAN DO THIS!\n\nI believe that ANYONE can learn the drums, and I believe you\u2019re far more capable of becoming a great drummer than you think you are. Don\u2019t sell yourself short!

PDF guide, \u201c5 Steps to Learning Any Song in Under an Hour.\u201d https://the-non-glamorous-drummer.mykajabi.com/5-steps-to-learning-any-song-in-under-an-hour\n\nIf you feel like your snare sounds mediocre, the tuning strategies we\u2019re covering today will solve that for you and get your drum sounding professional. Today we\u2019re tuning up a super basic, cheap drum to show you that you absolutely CAN make any snare drum sound great. This is snare tuning 101, and maybe even 201. We\u2019re going to get your snare in tune and sounding amazing by covering top head tuning, resonant head tuning, and snare tension optimization. We\u2019re also troubleshooting common issues that come up with snare drums, like\u2026 Getting rid of annoying ring without using muffling, deadening a low-tuned snare without muffling, and using a special trick to get rid of any kind of ring without choking out your drum. If your snare is cheap, know that you can make it sound way better than you\u2019d think with some basic tuning skills. Enjoy!\n\nWe\u2019re also comparing a metal snare with a wood snare, an 8 lug snare with a 10 lug snare, steel shell versus maple shell, and 6.5\u201d depth vs 5.5\u201d depth. These two drums we\u2019re tuning up today are different in every way, regardless of \u201ccheapness.\u201d I hope your snare will relate more or less to one of these so that you\u2019ll learn some strategies for approaching the snare sound you\u2019ve been looking for. Whether you\u2019re wanting high and ringy or low and deep\u2026or anywhere in between\u2026 these methods will get you there. We troubleshoot every issue that comes our way, and we don\u2019t stop until we get the sound we want.

                        "description": "This video is an in-depth response to the folks who have been asking me how I tune snare drums.  Packed with a good bit of info it is useful for anyone really wanting to understand how to get great snare drum sound.  \n\nTuning is HUGE... but stick with me to the end to see how tuning can only take you so far.....!  (Time stamps are provided for quick navigation.)\n\n0:00 Introduction\n2:20 Broad drum tuning principles\n6:06 Tuning the snare drum - my process\n15:55 Why a tight snare side head? (explanation and demonstration)\n18:30 Attaching snare wires (and getting them straight!)\n24:00 How my initial tuning sounds (audio example)\n24:44 My heads and muffling in this example\n25:34 People use too much muffling (drums sound different miked)\n26:27 How mics hear drums differently than our ears\n28:22 My main variation to 'normal' tuning (and why...)\n33:12 Alternate tunings only for flexible hoops (NOT cast hoops)\n34:10 About snare wire tension\n35:48 One more thing -- THE REAL MAGIC TO THE RIGHT SOUND!\n39:52 Thanks for watching!! (please subscribe and share!! :)\n\nCare and feeding of cast hoops (video I referenced in this video):  https://youtu.be/uWTa_QQ5oQI"

                    "description": "This is the start of finally building my John Bonham replica green sparkle set, it's taken me years to track down the drums, parts and pieces (mainly the 26\" bass drum) but also good candidates for a rewrap, all of these drums had wrap issues, i do not rewrap nice original drums as people need those to complete other sets. This set is for me and will stay in my collection, as a huge Bonham fan this is something I've wanted to do for a very long time. \n\nThis is just how i do things, not really a \"how to\" video. As with everything I'm still always learning, figuring things out myself and adapting my years of wood wooding experience to repairing drums. I learn something new with every repair and each has it's own challenges, from simple to extensive like this. i had thought about replacing the whole diamond shaped area in blue tape of the inner ply but i think this worked out pretty well, it's not absolutely perfect which rarely exists in the vintage drum realm anyways lol but in the end it's strong, looks decent and no one will ever see it with the coated heads on anyways. almost every replica kit i've seen has a similar repair done as these 14 x 26 3 ply bass drums do not pop up every day, actually very rarely, virgin undrilled even less or never lol and usually very expensive so there is not a lot to chose from. \n\ni was extremely happy to come across this one, i didn't notice the hackery of the tom mount at first as it was covered by a gasket and washers but for what i paid for it and just even getting a chance to own one i'm still vary happy with the purchase.\n\nas always, thanks for watching.\n\n#drums #vintagedrums #ludwig #ludwigdrums #vintage #JohnBonham #LedZepplin #drummer",

                        "description": "This is the start of finally building my John Bonham replica green sparkle set, it's taken me years to track down the drums, parts and pieces (mainly the 26\" bass drum) but also good candidates for a rewrap, all of these drums had wrap issues, i do not rewrap nice original drums as people need those to complete other sets. This set is for me and will stay in my collection, as a huge Bonham fan this is something I've wanted to do for a very long time. \n\nThis is just how i do things, not really a \"how to\" video. As with everything I'm still always learning, figuring things out myself and adapting my years of wood wooding experience to repairing drums. I learn something new with every repair and each has it's own challenges, from simple to extensive like this. i had thought about replacing the whole diamond shaped area in blue tape of the inner ply but i think this worked out pretty well, it's not absolutely perfect which rarely exists in the vintage drum realm anyways lol but in the end it's strong, looks decent and no one will ever see it with the coated heads on anyways. almost every replica kit i've seen has a similar repair done as these 14 x 26 3 ply bass drums do not pop up every day, actually very rarely, virgin undrilled even less or never lol and usually very expensive so there is not a lot to chose from. \n\ni was extremely happy to come across this one, i didn't notice the hackery of the tom mount at first as it was covered by a gasket and washers but for what i paid for it and just even getting a chance to own one i'm still vary happy with the purchase.\n\nas always, thanks for watching.\n\n#drums #vintagedrums #ludwig #ludwigdrums #vintage #JohnBonham #LedZepplin #drummer"

I embarked upon wrapping them in some wood veneer. \n\nI would say that every type of drum refinishing is part of this video, depending on what you wanted to do. If simply rewrapping in plastic, substitute plastic instead of veneer. If removing plastic, and just finishing the shell, skip the veneer part. \n\nThanks for watching!",

I embarked upon wrapping them in some wood veneer. \n\nI would say that every type of drum refinishing is part of this video, depending on what you wanted to do. If simply rewrapping in plastic, substitute plastic instead of veneer. If removing plastic, and just finishing the shell, skip the veneer part. \n\nThanks for watching!"

                    "description": "How to Custom Paint Air Force 1's Tutorial\n\nHey cuties, in today's video, I explain step by step how I custom paint shoes.  In this case, I'm about to customize Nike Air Force 1's (AF1).  This tutorial is pretty in-depth but it should be easily digestible.  Because they're leather, these steps are a little different than if you paint on a shoe like Vans (which usually consist of canvas material.  Either way, a lot of the steps are the same but the preparation is a little different. \n\nAs you can see, it's a pretty basic design with color blocking.  This shoe still took around 5 or 6 hours total so make sure you are patient with the process to get the best results.\n\nI hope you enjoyed the video!

                        "description": "How to Custom Paint Air Force 1's Tutorial\n\nHey cuties, in today's video, I explain step by step how I custom paint shoes.  In this case, I'm about to customize Nike Air Force 1's (AF1).  This tutorial is pretty in-depth but it should be easily digestible.  Because they're leather, these steps are a little different than if you paint on a shoe like Vans (which usually consist of canvas material.  Either way, a lot of the steps are the same but the preparation is a little different. \n\nAs you can see, it's a pretty basic design with color blocking.  This shoe still took around 5 or 6 hours total so make sure you are patient with the process to get the best results.\n\nI hope you enjoyed the video!
