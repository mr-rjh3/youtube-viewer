Juicy Love Bedroom Empowerment - http://eepurl.com/iL4tzA\nVixen Academy:  https://thevixenacademy.com/\nLG Quiz: http://eepurl.com/hp6EkL\nYouTube: https://www.youtube.com/@staceyvixenacademy/videos\nMedia/Press: https://thevixenacademy.com/staceymurphymedia/\n\nPlease note: mysticdesignbystacey@gmail.com has been changed to vixenacademy@gmail.com\n\nInterested In Being Featured On The Channel? : http://bit.ly/Tour-Application\n\nVIDEO DESCRIPTION:\n\nJoin Stacey as she takes viewers on a tour of her beautiful tiny home, the Tiny Vixen. Designed with women in mind, this home is vibrant, functional, and cozy, showcasing how tiny living can be both spacious and welcoming. If you're a woman considering tiny living, this tour is for you!\n\nVibrant Living Room for Connection and Community\nWhen stepping into Stacey's living room, the first thing you'll notice is the vibrant art that brings the space to life. She designed this room to be a TV-free zone focused on connection and community. The seating area is perfect for putting on shoes or leaning against the credenza. This space is all about creating a welcoming atmosphere for friends and family.\n\nHeart of the Home: The Kitchen\nThe kitchen is the heart of Stacey's tiny home, and it was essential to her to have a functional and beautiful space. She worked with her builder to create more counter space by relocating the refrigerator and adding open shelves. The kitchen features a gas cooktop, a deep sink, and a Panasonic 4-in-1 appliance that bakes, air fries, saut\u00e9s, and pressure cooks. The kitchen is designed for both cooking and socializing, making it perfect for hosting.\n\nCozy and Functional Bathroom\nThough it's the smallest room in the house, Stacey's bathroom packs a mighty punch. It features wallpaper for a pop of color and a rain shower for a luxurious feel. She also included a crystal and plants to enhance the energy of the space. The quartz countertop and gold accents make the bathroom feel like a spa.\n\nPractical Laundry and Storage Solutions\nIn the hallway, Stacey opted for a washer and dryer instead of a linen closet, making it a practical choice for tiny living. The broom closet and pantry provide additional storage space. This setup ensures that every inch of space is used efficiently.\n\nMeditation and Zen Space\nStacey's loft serves as a meditation room and office, divided by a bookshelf with plants. The serene environment is perfect for starting the day with meditation and capturing inspiration for her coaching and business. The space also includes a TV area with a pop of blue for relaxation.\n\nMystic Design Bedroom\nThe bedroom is Stacey's sanctuary with a Mystic design, featuring artwork that brings the space to life. The dresser bay and three shades of pink make the room feel larger and more inviting. The closet offers ample storage, and the step stool helps her reach everything. The double bed provides walking space and complements the aesthetic of the room.\n\nEmpowerment and Connection\nStacey believes in using her home as a 3D vision board to manifest love, health, and wealth. The Mystic design elements throughout the Tiny Vixen reflect this philosophy. She encourages viewers to explore their own Mystic design with the free Bedroom Empowerment gift linked in the description.\n\nJoin the Tiny Living Movement\nTiny living is becoming an essential solution to housing affordability. Stacey's journey from New York to Orlando and finally to California has shown her the transformative power of tiny living. She's passionate about advocating for this lifestyle and helping others find security and joy in tiny spaces.\n\nConnect with Stacy\nIf you have questions about tiny living, design tips, or her cross-country journey, feel free to reach out to her at mysticddesignbystacey@gmail.com or visit her website at mysticddesignbystacey.com.

                        "description": "Her Links:\nFREE GIFT! Juicy Love Bedroom Empowerment - http://eepurl.com/iL4tzA\nVixen Academy:  https://thevixenacademy.com/\nLG Quiz: http://eepurl.com/hp6EkL\nYouTube: https://www.youtube.com/@staceyvixenacademy/videos\nMedia/Press: https://thevixenacademy.com/staceymurphymedia/\n\nPlease note: mysticdesignbystacey@gmail.com has been changed to vixenacademy@gmail.com\n\nInterested In Being Featured On The Channel? : http://bit.ly/Tour-Application\n\nVIDEO DESCRIPTION:\n\nJoin Stacey as she takes viewers on a tour of her beautiful tiny home, the Tiny Vixen. Designed with women in mind, this home is vibrant, functional, and cozy, showcasing how tiny living can be both spacious and welcoming. If you're a woman considering tiny living, this tour is for you!\n\nVibrant Living Room for Connection and Community\nWhen stepping into Stacey's living room, the first thing you'll notice is the vibrant art that brings the space to life. She designed this room to be a TV-free zone focused on connection and community. The seating area is perfect for putting on shoes or leaning against the credenza. This space is all about creating a welcoming atmosphere for friends and family.\n\nHeart of the Home: The Kitchen\nThe kitchen is the heart of Stacey's tiny home, and it was essential to her to have a functional and beautiful space. She worked with her builder to create more counter space by relocating the refrigerator and adding open shelves. The kitchen features a gas cooktop, a deep sink, and a Panasonic 4-in-1 appliance that bakes, air fries, saut\u00e9s, and pressure cooks. The kitchen is designed for both cooking and socializing, making it perfect for hosting.\n\nCozy and Functional Bathroom\nThough it's the smallest room in the house, Stacey's bathroom packs a mighty punch. It features wallpaper for a pop of color and a rain shower for a luxurious feel. She also included a crystal and plants to enhance the energy of the space. The quartz countertop and gold accents make the bathroom feel like a spa.\n\nPractical Laundry and Storage Solutions\nIn the hallway, Stacey opted for a washer and dryer instead of a linen closet, making it a practical choice for tiny living. The broom closet and pantry provide additional storage space. This setup ensures that every inch of space is used efficiently.\n\nMeditation and Zen Space\nStacey's loft serves as a meditation room and office, divided by a bookshelf with plants. The serene environment is perfect for starting the day with meditation and capturing inspiration for her coaching and business. The space also includes a TV area with a pop of blue for relaxation.\n\nMystic Design Bedroom\nThe bedroom is Stacey's sanctuary with a Mystic design, featuring artwork that brings the space to life. The dresser bay and three shades of pink make the room feel larger and more inviting. The closet offers ample storage, and the step stool helps her reach everything. The double bed provides walking space and complements the aesthetic of the room.\n\nEmpowerment and Connection\nStacey believes in using her home as a 3D vision board to manifest love, health, and wealth. The Mystic design elements throughout the Tiny Vixen reflect this philosophy. She encourages viewers to explore their own Mystic design with the free Bedroom Empowerment gift linked in the description.\n\nJoin the Tiny Living Movement\nTiny living is becoming an essential solution to housing affordability. Stacey's journey from New York to Orlando and finally to California has shown her the transformative power of tiny living. She's passionate about advocating for this lifestyle and helping others find security and joy in tiny spaces.\n\nConnect with Stacy\nIf you have questions about tiny living, design tips, or her cross-country journey, feel free to reach out to her at mysticddesignbystacey@gmail.com or visit her website at mysticddesignbystacey.com.

It features a creative staircase vanity and pull-out closet system that stores 40 shoes! The idea to build a tiny house on wheels began as a high school project. After graduating, she built her 150 sqft tiny house for cash over 3 years. It cost her less than $18k, thanks to her resourcefulness & Fb Marketplace scores. During the process, she fell in love and added a gaming setup in the loft for her husband. Now, their tiny home is parked on their own land, where they're renovating the main house to rent, creating lush outdoor living space, and building a shed conversion man-cave.\n\n\ud83c\udfe1\ud83d\udee0\ufe0f\ud83d\udc49 Check out Tiffany's YT channel, @beautyandabuilder \n\ud83d\udc49 Follow her: instagram.com/beautyandabuilder & tiktok.com/@beautyandabuilder\n\n\ud83d\udc49CONNECT with tiny nerds, Alexis & Christian:\nhttps://www.tiktok.com/@tiny_house_expedition \nhttps://instagram.com/tiny_house_expedition\nhttps://facebook.com/TinyHouseExpedition\n\nPlease SUBSCRIBE for more tiny houses, DIY, design, community, simple living & alternative lifestyle, and documentaries. \ud83c\udfe1\u2728\u2764\ufe0f\n\n\ud83e\udd1d Brand Deals: tinyhouseexpedition@thestation.io\n\n\u2728Check out our website for tiny house resources: https://tinyhouseexpedition.com \ud83d\udc40\n\nCREDITS:\n\u2747\ufe0f produced by Tiny House Expedition's Christian & Alexis\n\u2747\ufe0f shot by Blake Hemmel, https://www.youtube.com/c/BlakeHemmel\n\u2747\ufe0f edited by Payton Wagner, https://vimeo.com/paytonwagner\n\u2747\ufe0f  additional photos provided by @beautyandabuilder \n\nVideo Chapters:\n0:00 - DIY tiny house on own land\n1:30 - interior tiny house tour\n3:23 - custom closet system\n6:12 - sponsor message\n7:15 - living room\n8:59 - tiny kitchen\n12:30 - family story\n14:02 - DIY American dream \n14:52 - tiny bathroom\n17:08 - loft bedroom & gaming setup\n19:05 - her build journey\n20:45 - tiny house cost & financing\n22:28 - her advice\n22:58 - more tiny homes!\n\n#tinyhouse #tinyhousebuild #tinyhousemovement #jackery #jackery1000 \u00a0#solargenerator \u00a0#jackery1000v2 #whatcanjackerypower",

It features a creative staircase vanity and pull-out closet system that stores 40 shoes! The idea to build a tiny house on wheels began as a high school project. After graduating, she built her 150 sqft tiny house for cash over 3 years. It cost her less than $18k, thanks to her resourcefulness & Fb Marketplace scores. During the process, she fell in love and added a gaming setup in the loft for her husband. Now, their tiny home is parked on their own land, where they're renovating the main house to rent, creating lush outdoor living space, and building a shed conversion man-cave.\n\n\ud83c\udfe1\ud83d\udee0\ufe0f\ud83d\udc49 Check out Tiffany's YT channel, @beautyandabuilder \n\ud83d\udc49 Follow her: instagram.com/beautyandabuilder & tiktok.com/@beautyandabuilder\n\n\ud83d\udc49CONNECT with tiny nerds, Alexis & Christian:\nhttps://www.tiktok.com/@tiny_house_expedition \nhttps://instagram.com/tiny_house_expedition\nhttps://facebook.com/TinyHouseExpedition\n\nPlease SUBSCRIBE for more tiny houses, DIY, design, community, simple living & alternative lifestyle, and documentaries. \ud83c\udfe1\u2728\u2764\ufe0f\n\n\ud83e\udd1d Brand Deals: tinyhouseexpedition@thestation.io\n\n\u2728Check out our website for tiny house resources: https://tinyhouseexpedition.com \ud83d\udc40\n\nCREDITS:\n\u2747\ufe0f produced by Tiny House Expedition's Christian & Alexis\n\u2747\ufe0f shot by Blake Hemmel, https://www.youtube.com/c/BlakeHemmel\n\u2747\ufe0f edited by Payton Wagner, https://vimeo.com/paytonwagner\n\u2747\ufe0f  additional photos provided by @beautyandabuilder \n\nVideo Chapters:\n0:00 - DIY tiny house on own land\n1:30 - interior tiny house tour\n3:23 - custom closet system\n6:12 - sponsor message\n7:15 - living room\n8:59 - tiny kitchen\n12:30 - family story\n14:02 - DIY American dream \n14:52 - tiny bathroom\n17:08 - loft bedroom & gaming setup\n19:05 - her build journey\n20:45 - tiny house cost & financing\n22:28 - her advice\n22:58 - more tiny homes!\n\n#tinyhouse #tinyhousebuild #tinyhousemovement #jackery #jackery1000 \u00a0#solargenerator \u00a0#jackery1000v2 #whatcanjackerypower"

                    "description": "When Jennava Laska first visited the underground home for sale in Nashville, Tennessee it had been on the market for seven years looked like a \u201chorror movie house\u201d or a long-abandoned cellar. She saw potential in the home\u2019s spoke-and-wheel design to create an underground Mediterranean villa and bought the long-neglected property.\n\nWhen Gene Tidwell, one of the designers of Nashville\u2019s iconic Batman Building, built the home in 1983, he buried it at the top a hillside to avoid the Tennessee bedrock at the bottom of the driveway and to dig into the much softer slate up top.\n\nThe home forms a tunnel through the hill with windows at each end to let in light and with the 2 skylights, the space feel light and airy despite being buried. Laska opened up the home by removing the walls that divided the tunnel section so now you can see straight through the home from one end to another.

                        "description": "When Jennava Laska first visited the underground home for sale in Nashville, Tennessee it had been on the market for seven years looked like a \u201chorror movie house\u201d or a long-abandoned cellar. She saw potential in the home\u2019s spoke-and-wheel design to create an underground Mediterranean villa and bought the long-neglected property.\n\nWhen Gene Tidwell, one of the designers of Nashville\u2019s iconic Batman Building, built the home in 1983, he buried it at the top a hillside to avoid the Tennessee bedrock at the bottom of the driveway and to dig into the much softer slate up top.\n\nThe home forms a tunnel through the hill with windows at each end to let in light and with the 2 skylights, the space feel light and airy despite being buried. Laska opened up the home by removing the walls that divided the tunnel section so now you can see straight through the home from one end to another. She wanted this main area to feel like the atrium at the center of a Roman Villa with bedrooms and living room branching off from this main space.\n\nLaska says the space remains naturally cool in summer and warm in winter though she installed a heat pump for the especially hot or cold days and a dehumidifier for the summer. Since radon gas can build up in the shale rock, she installed a radon filter with a fan that continuously filters air from below the home.\n\nhttps://undergroundvilla.com/underground-house\n\nOn *faircompanies https://faircompanies.com/videos/property-sat-7-years-unsold-she-created-dream-underground-villa/"

The home takes advantage of the sun's heat by being oriented toward the south for maximum solar gain during the day and the concrete floors trap that heat to be released throughout the evening. If there is ever a particularly cold night or days without sun, the couple installed a wood-burning stove to bring up the indoor temperature by a few degrees, but not much is needed, even in those circumstances.\n\nGiven the chronic drought in the region, Olivia and Nil installed a worm composting toilet. Other than the urine-separating element, it looks like a standard toilet, and only needs to be emptied of finished compost every two years.\n\nAn avid cyclist, for Nil this area is a dream come true.

                    "description": "Concerned about indoor air quality, Neil Decker and Stella Michaels wanted their home to be chemical-free, so they decided to build it out of hempcrete (hemp, lime, and sand). \n\nThe couple didn\u2019t think they could afford to live in California but found a rundown property in Gold Rush old country on the Western Slope of Sierra Nevada just outside Nevada City (above 2500 feet, with cold winters), where they moved into a fifth wheel trailer while constructing their home.\n\nThey had experience building with earth-bags (flexible formed rammed earth) but felt it was too hard on the body. They knew hempcrete was lightweight and was easy to work with. They were able to raise half the house in 5 days. \n\nThey then trained and hired local students to help finish the exterior build just before the winter rains. They then let the house get wet and dry during the winter, which helps to harden the lime before adding a lime plaster to the exterior. The couple added clay plasters to the walls for the interior and laid an earthen cob floor. \n\nThe couple was told by locals that we wouldn\u2019t be able to get hempcrete approved, but the local building department told them as long as they met the codes for insulation value and raking strength, there should be no problems. And in 2016, they were the first hempcrete home approved in California. Decker explains that not only is hempcrete extremely durable, but it\u2019s also fire and earthquake-resistant and can help with indoor air quality since it\u2019s very breathable and mold-reducing.\n\nDecker had spent a lot of time in yurts as a ski guide, and he liked how it felt to live in a circular structure, so they decided to design a perfectly round home. They spent 2 years observing how energy flowed through our property to choose a building site. \n\nInspired by Earthship design, the home is passive solar with nearly all glass on the south, passive cooling with a 6-foot openable skylight controlled by a thermostat that allows heat to escape when indoor temperatures rise above 75 degrees. \n\nCooling tubes are buried 5ft underground and run 50 ft in front of the home to cool ambient air outside the house's interior. Cool air is passively pulled into the tubes as hot air escapes out of the skylight in the summer.\n\nNeil & Stella's home is among California's first permitted hemp homes.\n\nTIMELINE:\n\n0:18 Moved to a more affordable area outside Nevada City (Sierra Nevada foothills) and built a 40-foot Hemp Roundhouse (1st hemp roundhouse in the US, among the first permitted hempcrete homes in CA).\n4:27 Living on the property while building.\n8:50 Using clay plaster and hemcrete in building a sustainable home.\n13:40 Hempcrete specs as building material (a breathable wall system made of hemp, lime, and water used to restore traditional buildings and is now being used to build houses).\n18:15 Earthen floor that provides grounding and natural healing.\n22:01 They wanted a small, simple bedroom with soft lighting, and the whole place tries to inspire calm and natural beauty.\n26:19 Neil Decker's background living in a roundhouse and the benefits of its design.\n30:32 Home uses passive cooling systems to reduce utility bills.\n34:50 They wanted a healthy home that would last multiple generations and were excited about their house's unique and special features.\n\nSome people are suggesting in the comments that Nils affirmation about \"grounding\" of the human body with the Earth is some invention. The reality is more complex, and several scientific studies explore \"Earthing\" (or reconnection with our environment) by, for example, frequently going barefoot. Here's one article published in 2012 (from the National Library of Medicine): \"Earthing: Health Implications of Reconnecting the Human Body to the Earth's Surface Electrons\": https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3265077/\n\nAbstract of the paper: \"Environmental medicine generally addresses environmental factors with a negative impact on human health. However, emerging scientific research has revealed a surprisingly positive and overlooked environmental factor on health: direct physical contact with the vast supply of electrons on the surface of the Earth. Modern lifestyle separates humans from such contact. The research suggests that this disconnect may be a major contributor to physiological dysfunction and unwellness. Reconnection with the Earth's electrons has been found to promote intriguing physiological changes and subjective reports of well-being.\"\n\n\u2014Hempcrete Roundhome owners' personal website, Starseed Creative: https://www.starseedcreative.com/\n\u2014Check Neil Decker's video on the house project, \"1st Hempcrete Round House in the USA\" https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jThZxJNo7Lc\n\u2014Neil Decker's channel: https://www.youtube.com/@neildecker1\n\nOn *faircompanies: https://faircompanies.com/videos/6-years-building-healthy-natural-roundhome-with-hempcrete-cob/",

                        "title": "Couple builds dream natural Roundhouse with hempcrete, cob & lime \ud83d\udc1a",
                        "description": "Concerned about indoor air quality, Neil Decker and Stella Michaels wanted their home to be chemical-free, so they decided to build it out of hempcrete (hemp, lime, and sand). \n\nThe couple didn\u2019t think they could afford to live in California but found a rundown property in Gold Rush old country on the Western Slope of Sierra Nevada just outside Nevada City (above 2500 feet, with cold winters), where they moved into a fifth wheel trailer while constructing their home.\n\nThey had experience building with earth-bags (flexible formed rammed earth) but felt it was too hard on the body. They knew hempcrete was lightweight and was easy to work with. They were able to raise half the house in 5 days. \n\nThey then trained and hired local students to help finish the exterior build just before the winter rains. They then let the house get wet and dry during the winter, which helps to harden the lime before adding a lime plaster to the exterior. The couple added clay plasters to the walls for the interior and laid an earthen cob floor. \n\nThe couple was told by locals that we wouldn\u2019t be able to get hempcrete approved, but the local building department told them as long as they met the codes for insulation value and raking strength, there should be no problems. And in 2016, they were the first hempcrete home approved in California. Decker explains that not only is hempcrete extremely durable, but it\u2019s also fire and earthquake-resistant and can help with indoor air quality since it\u2019s very breathable and mold-reducing.\n\nDecker had spent a lot of time in yurts as a ski guide, and he liked how it felt to live in a circular structure, so they decided to design a perfectly round home. They spent 2 years observing how energy flowed through our property to choose a building site. \n\nInspired by Earthship design, the home is passive solar with nearly all glass on the south, passive cooling with a 6-foot openable skylight controlled by a thermostat that allows heat to escape when indoor temperatures rise above 75 degrees. \n\nCooling tubes are buried 5ft underground and run 50 ft in front of the home to cool ambient air outside the house's interior. Cool air is passively pulled into the tubes as hot air escapes out of the skylight in the summer.\n\nNeil & Stella's home is among California's first permitted hemp homes.\n\nTIMELINE:\n\n0:18 Moved to a more affordable area outside Nevada City (Sierra Nevada foothills) and built a 40-foot Hemp Roundhouse (1st hemp roundhouse in the US, among the first permitted hempcrete homes in CA).\n4:27 Living on the property while building.\n8:50 Using clay plaster and hemcrete in building a sustainable home.\n13:40 Hempcrete specs as building material (a breathable wall system made of hemp, lime, and water used to restore traditional buildings and is now being used to build houses).\n18:15 Earthen floor that provides grounding and natural healing.\n22:01 They wanted a small, simple bedroom with soft lighting, and the whole place tries to inspire calm and natural beauty.\n26:19 Neil Decker's background living in a roundhouse and the benefits of its design.\n30:32 Home uses passive cooling systems to reduce utility bills.\n34:50 They wanted a healthy home that would last multiple generations and were excited about their house's unique and special features.\n\nSome people are suggesting in the comments that Nils affirmation about \"grounding\" of the human body with the Earth is some invention. The reality is more complex, and several scientific studies explore \"Earthing\" (or reconnection with our environment) by, for example, frequently going barefoot. Here's one article published in 2012 (from the National Library of Medicine): \"Earthing: Health Implications of Reconnecting the Human Body to the Earth's Surface Electrons\": https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3265077/\n\nAbstract of the paper: \"Environmental medicine generally addresses environmental factors with a negative impact on human health. However, emerging scientific research has revealed a surprisingly positive and overlooked environmental factor on health: direct physical contact with the vast supply of electrons on the surface of the Earth. Modern lifestyle separates humans from such contact. The research suggests that this disconnect may be a major contributor to physiological dysfunction and unwellness. Reconnection with the Earth's electrons has been found to promote intriguing physiological changes and subjective reports of well-being.\"\n\n\u2014Hempcrete Roundhome owners' personal website, Starseed Creative: https://www.starseedcreative.com/\n\u2014Check Neil Decker's video on the house project, \"1st Hempcrete Round House in the USA\" https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jThZxJNo7Lc\n\u2014Neil Decker's channel: https://www.youtube.com/@neildecker1\n\nOn *faircompanies: https://faircompanies.com/videos/6-years-building-healthy-natural-roundhome-with-hempcrete-cob/"

Global warming, soaring fuel and food prices, on and on it goes. But Liz Hayes has managed to find a tiny glimmer of hope, a community that's beating the 21st century blues. A place that gives \"people power\" a whole new meaning. There are no electricity or water bills, they grow their own food and recycle everything. They've simply unplugged. Once it was dismissed as just a hippy-trippy dream, now it's a great, practical idea that's spreading around the world. And the good news is, it's painless.

Global warming, soaring fuel and food prices, on and on it goes. But Liz Hayes has managed to find a tiny glimmer of hope, a community that's beating the 21st century blues. A place that gives \"people power\" a whole new meaning. There are no electricity or water bills, they grow their own food and recycle everything. They've simply unplugged. Once it was dismissed as just a hippy-trippy dream, now it's a great, practical idea that's spreading around the world. And the good news is, it's painless. The good life, with all creature comforts intact. \n\nWATCH more of 60 Minutes Australia: https://www.60minutes.com.au \nLIKE 60 Minutes Australia on Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/60Minutes9 \nFOLLOW 60 Minutes Australia on Twitter: https://twitter.com/60Mins \nFOLLOW 60 Minutes Australia on Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/60minutes9\n\nFor over forty years, 60 Minutes have been telling Australians the world\u2019s greatest stories.

Over the course of a decade and through countless IVF attempts, Mary and George struggled to conceive. When they finally did fall pregnant there was more tragedy, with the stillbirth of daughter Stevie. Unbelievably, Mary and George kept on trying, returning to their fertility clinic in Greece for six more IVF treatments. Then, just as they were about to give up the parenthood dream forever, their luck changed. On 60 Minutes, Mary and George proudly show off beautiful little Jamie for the first time, and reveal there could be one more surprise in store.\n\nWATCH more of 60 Minutes Australia: https://www.60minutes.com.au \nLIKE 60 Minutes Australia on Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/60Minutes9 \nFOLLOW 60 Minutes Australia on Twitter: https://twitter.com/60Mins \nFOLLOW 60 Minutes Australia on Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/60minutes9\n\nFor forty years, 60 Minutes have been telling Australians the world\u2019s greatest stories.

She recently produced and presented the documentary \u2018Young and Addicted: Generation Ketamine\u201d which took a graphic look at the impacts of recreational ketamine use. \n\nFor anyone who doesn\u2019t know,\n\nKetamine is a medical drug that has been used since the 70\u2019s. It is safe in small doses and is effective in assisting the treatment of some mental health conditions. Ketamine is also popular as an illicit drug in the UK, Europe, North America, and many countries in Asia and is growing in popularity in Australia and New Zealand. \n\nAs stated in the documentary, Government figures have shown that Ketamine addiction has more than quadrupled since 2016 in England and Wales. What may not yet be common knowledge is that the drug has serious health consequences. \n\nRachel gives of background about herself and how she ended up involved in the documentary. She tells us what inspired her to specifically make a documentary about ketamine addiction. She shares insights from her experience and how this has changed her views of the drug. \n\nShe discusses insights from people she spoke to with lived experience as well as experts.

                    "description": "In this video, we meet David Johns, a former TV journalist from the UK who quit his job, sold his house, and bought a narrowboat to cruise the canal network.  His plan was to try being a live aboard for a year. He\u2019s been living aboard for 9 months so far and he\u2019s still happy with his decision and loves being part of the friendly, helpful narrowboat community.  \n\nWatch this video to take a tour of David's narrowboat, learn how he earns an income as a freelance journalist, where he \u201cparks\u201d his boat, and about the joys & challenges of life afloat.\n\nDavid has been documenting his journey living on a boat with a regular vlog on his YouTube channel: Cruising the Cut (https://www.youtube.com/CruisingTheCutUK).  With his experience as a TV journalist, the videos are extremely well filmed and edited, and they're a real pleasure to watch.\n\nWe were excited when he sent us his interview footage because we learned so much about this alternative lifestyle that he\u2019s trying out. We love the idea of living in a tiny house on the water and of being able to explore from the comfort of your own home (a lot like living in a van!).\n\nThanks for watching!\n\nMat & Danielle\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------\nSTAY IN TOUCH!\n------------------------------------------------------------\n\nBlog: www.exploringalternatives.ca\nFacebook: /exploringalternativesblog\nInstagram: @exploringalternatives\n\nMusic & Song Credits: \nAll music in this video was composed, performed, and recorded by Mat of Exploring Alternatives.\n\nFilming Credit:\nAll footage in this video was filmed by David Johns from Cruising the Cut: https://www.youtube.com/CruisingTheCutUK",

It was one of 25 boats built in Victoria, Canada for Expo '86 but it had fallen into disrepair.   With some incredible woodwork and craftsmanship by the pair, respectively a shipwright and a carpenter, it's now an absolutely stunning 1 bedroom home on the water!! \n\nYou can follow Jason on Instagram here:\nhttps://www.instagram.com/wood_and_wind/ \n\nThe houseboat is packed with neat features: a head with a composting toilet and a livestock trough bathtub, a chart table, a bright galley, a handmade curved cedar dinette, a storage staircase, cozy sleeping and relaxing lofts that are connected by a catwalk, and a ladder that leads to a rooftop deck.  \n\nThanks for watching!\n\nMat & Danielle\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------\nSTAY IN TOUCH!\n-------------------------------------------------------------\n\nWebsite: www.exploringalternatives.ca\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/exploringalternativesblog\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/exploringalternatives/\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------\nCOMMENTS\n-------------------------------------------------------------\n\nWe want our channel and our comments section to be an inclusive space where everyone feels welcome to watch and contribute.

                        "description": "Pax is a tiny float home that was lovingly restored and renovated by Jason and Cayley over the course of a year and a half.  It was one of 25 boats built in Victoria, Canada for Expo '86 but it had fallen into disrepair.   With some incredible woodwork and craftsmanship by the pair, respectively a shipwright and a carpenter, it's now an absolutely stunning 1 bedroom home on the water!! \n\nYou can follow Jason on Instagram here:\nhttps://www.instagram.com/wood_and_wind/ \n\nThe houseboat is packed with neat features: a head with a composting toilet and a livestock trough bathtub, a chart table, a bright galley, a handmade curved cedar dinette, a storage staircase, cozy sleeping and relaxing lofts that are connected by a catwalk, and a ladder that leads to a rooftop deck.  \n\nThanks for watching!\n\nMat & Danielle\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------\nSTAY IN TOUCH!\n-------------------------------------------------------------\n\nWebsite: www.exploringalternatives.ca\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/exploringalternativesblog\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/exploringalternatives/\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------\nCOMMENTS\n-------------------------------------------------------------\n\nWe want our channel and our comments section to be an inclusive space where everyone feels welcome to watch and contribute.

                    "description": "It's a clash of two TV legends as Jay Leno recently called his custom Orange County Chopper \"junk\" after the bike experienced an electrical problem and a breakdown on a California Highway many years ago. We caught up with Orange County Choppers frontman Paul Teutul Sr. to get his response to Jay Leno's criticism of his famous motorcycles.  Jay Leno says he was never a fan of choppers because he doesn't understand the concept of making it slower will less braking power and control. OCC's Paul Teutul Sr argues that he rides his chopper all over and it's not a riding style for everyone. Paul Teutul Sr. also talks about Orange County Choppers' many appearances on the Tonight Show and how he feels the true reason for the for Leno calling out his bike could be that he appeared on Dave Letterman's Tonight Show twice as much.  We also ask the 75-year-old Orange County Chopper star what he's doing now, how he likes living in Florida and what's up next for the OCC Brand.       \n\nSubscribe to Cycledrag \u25ba https://www.youtube.com/CycleDrag",

                        "description": "It's a clash of two TV legends as Jay Leno recently called his custom Orange County Chopper \"junk\" after the bike experienced an electrical problem and a breakdown on a California Highway many years ago. We caught up with Orange County Choppers frontman Paul Teutul Sr. to get his response to Jay Leno's criticism of his famous motorcycles.  Jay Leno says he was never a fan of choppers because he doesn't understand the concept of making it slower will less braking power and control. OCC's Paul Teutul Sr argues that he rides his chopper all over and it's not a riding style for everyone. Paul Teutul Sr. also talks about Orange County Choppers' many appearances on the Tonight Show and how he feels the true reason for the for Leno calling out his bike could be that he appeared on Dave Letterman's Tonight Show twice as much.  We also ask the 75-year-old Orange County Chopper star what he's doing now, how he likes living in Florida and what's up next for the OCC Brand.       \n\nSubscribe to Cycledrag \u25ba https://www.youtube.com/CycleDrag"

Check out their GeoGebra files here:\nhttps://www.geogebra.org/m/kuntcc5a\nhttps://www.geogebra.org/u/sparksmaths\n\nRotating 3D book was thanks to Tim Waskett of Stone Baked Games.\nhttps://www.stonebakedgames.com/\n\nThere are plenty more Matt and Hugh videos to learn about moments of inertia and suchlike.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLhtC92GarkjwweBkdrq5uPzEjnRF6ncCV\n\nHugh Hunt is the Cambridge University Reader in Engineering Dynamics and Vibration. I know!\nhttp://www2.eng.cam.ac.uk/~hemh1/\n\nZero G footage courtesy The Cosmic Shambles Network working in association with the European Space Agency. In flight footage shot by Melanie Cowan. External plane footage courtesy Novespace.\n\nCORRECTIONS\n- At 11:00 and 14:23 I say the axes correspond to the axes of rotation but technically they represent the three different directions of spin. Which is why they are labelled with omegas representing the angular\u00a0velocities in those directions.\n- At 05:52 the ellipsoid equation should be \u201cvolume\u201d not \u201carea\u201d. First pointed out by Ihsan Khairir. My fault for not paying attention editing the text after copying the previous equations.\n- Oh my goodness. At 11:50 we missed an \u201cL\u201d in ellipsoid. First pointed out by Daniel Burger. I\u2019m so embarrassed.\n- Let me know if you spot any other mistakes. Or, you know, make a whole video about it.\n\n\nAs always: thanks to Jane Street who support my channel.

Check out their GeoGebra files here:\nhttps://www.geogebra.org/m/kuntcc5a\nhttps://www.geogebra.org/u/sparksmaths\n\nRotating 3D book was thanks to Tim Waskett of Stone Baked Games.\nhttps://www.stonebakedgames.com/\n\nThere are plenty more Matt and Hugh videos to learn about moments of inertia and suchlike.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLhtC92GarkjwweBkdrq5uPzEjnRF6ncCV\n\nHugh Hunt is the Cambridge University Reader in Engineering Dynamics and Vibration. I know!\nhttp://www2.eng.cam.ac.uk/~hemh1/\n\nZero G footage courtesy The Cosmic Shambles Network working in association with the European Space Agency. In flight footage shot by Melanie Cowan. External plane footage courtesy Novespace.\n\nCORRECTIONS\n- At 11:00 and 14:23 I say the axes correspond to the axes of rotation but technically they represent the three different directions of spin. Which is why they are labelled with omegas representing the angular\u00a0velocities in those directions.\n- At 05:52 the ellipsoid equation should be \u201cvolume\u201d not \u201carea\u201d. First pointed out by Ihsan Khairir. My fault for not paying attention editing the text after copying the previous equations.\n- Oh my goodness. At 11:50 we missed an \u201cL\u201d in ellipsoid. First pointed out by Daniel Burger. I\u2019m so embarrassed.\n- Let me know if you spot any other mistakes. Or, you know, make a whole video about it.\n\n\nAs always: thanks to Jane Street who support my channel. They're amazing.\nhttps://www.janestreet.com/\n\nFilming and editing by Trunkman Productions\nAdditional filming by Melanie Cowan\nAudio by Peter Doggart\nMusic by Howard Carter\nDesign by Simon Wright and Adam Robinson\n\nMATT PARKER: Stand-up Mathematician\nWebsite: http://standupmaths.com/\nUS book: https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/610964/humble-pi-by-matt-parker/\nUK book: https://mathsgear.co.uk/products/5b9fa76f230ffa140094dc43\nNerdy maths toys: http://mathsgear.co.uk/"

In fact, this is a strict inequality - if the energy is highest possible, there are no other possible combinations of momenta other than L2=L3=0, and vice versa for if the energy is the lowest possible.\n\nBecause of this, in the case of axis 1 the energy is so high that there simply aren't any other possible combinations of angular momentum components L1, L2 and L3 - the object would have to lose energy in order to spin differently. And in the case of axis 3, the energy is so low that there likewise is no way for the object to be rotating other than purely around axis 3 - it would have to gain energy.

In the first three months of 2024, less than a quarter of car buyers leased vehicles, but more than a third of EV buyers did. By May, nearly 70% of customers getting EVs through dealerships were leased. But EV leasing is problematic for carmakers. While the discounts suggest automakers could be offsetting losses in their EV businesses, the resale values are especially low for them.\n\nChapters:\n00:57 Title card: Why EVs have a leasing problem \n01:04 Chapter 1: Leasing and EVs\n02:54 Chapter 2: Consumers and leasing\n06:10 Chapter 3: Automakers and leasing\n10:02 Chapter 4: Future of EV leasing\n\nProducer: Robert Ferris\nEditor: Darren Geeter \nAnimation: Christina Locopo\nSenior Managing Producer: Tala Hadavi\nAdditional footage: Getty Images, Rivian, Tesla, Ford, GM, Hyundai, Polestar\n\n\u00bb Subscribe to CNBC: https://cnb.cx/SubscribeCNBC\n\u00bb Subscribe to CNBC TV: https://cnb.cx/SubscribeCNBCtelevision\n\nAbout CNBC: From 'Wall Street' to 'Main Street' to award winning original documentaries and Reality TV series, CNBC has you covered.

                    "description": "On satellite imagery, we spotted a village inside a strange crater in Madagascar. We set out to learn how it got there.\n\nSubscribe to our channel! http://goo.gl/0bsAjO\n\nRight in the center of the island nation of Madagascar there\u2019s a strange, almost perfectly circular geological structure. It covers a bigger area than the city of Paris \u2014 and at first glance, it looks completely empty. But right in the center of that structure, there\u2019s a single, isolated village: a few dozen houses, some fields of crops, and dirt roads stretching out in every direction. \n\nWhen we first saw this village on Google Earth, its extreme remoteness fascinated us. Was the village full of people? How did they wind up there? And what did life look like in such a strange geography? To find out, we teamed up with a local team in Madagascar and fell down a rabbit hole of geology and mapping along the way. It\u2019s a story of how continental shifts and volcanic geology came together to form a place for a group of people to call home. \n\nCheck out an extended look at the interviews in this video: https://youtu.be/YIOon-drZhE\n\nWe got to talk with a lot of experts along the way to make this piece. Here are links to some of their work:\n\nHere is some of Michel J\u00e9brak\u2019s research on the Richat structure: https://www.researchgate.net/publication/32048440_Resolving_the_Richat_enigma_Doming_and_hydrothermal_karstification_above_an_alkaline_complex\n\nHere is Ndivhuwo Cecilia Mukosi\u2019s original paper on the Ambohiby Complex: https://www.researchgate.net/publication/318723814_Petrogenesis_of_the_Ambohiby_Complex_Madagascar_and_the_role_of_the_Marion_Hotspot_plume\n\nWe also spoke with Stian Rice, author of Famine in the Remaking, who helped us understand more about the history of agriculture in Madagascar:  https://gjia.georgetown.edu/2022/01/24/madagascars-famine-is-more-than-climate-change/\n\nCheck out Stian\u2019s book on famine and food systems: https://wvupressonline.com/node/831\n\nNorman Thomas Uphoff at Cornell\u2019s SRI International Network also shared more about agricultural systems and innovation: http://sri.ciifad.cornell.edu/\n\nCorrection: At 2:52, we mistakenly labeled Lucienne Wilm\u00e9 as a professor of geology at the University of Florida. In fact, she is a national coordinator of the Madagascar Program at the World Resources Institute. \n\nVox.com is a news website that helps you cut through the noise and understand what's really driving the events in the headlines.

                        "description": "On satellite imagery, we spotted a village inside a strange crater in Madagascar. We set out to learn how it got there.\n\nSubscribe to our channel! http://goo.gl/0bsAjO\n\nRight in the center of the island nation of Madagascar there\u2019s a strange, almost perfectly circular geological structure. It covers a bigger area than the city of Paris \u2014 and at first glance, it looks completely empty. But right in the center of that structure, there\u2019s a single, isolated village: a few dozen houses, some fields of crops, and dirt roads stretching out in every direction. \n\nWhen we first saw this village on Google Earth, its extreme remoteness fascinated us. Was the village full of people? How did they wind up there? And what did life look like in such a strange geography? To find out, we teamed up with a local team in Madagascar and fell down a rabbit hole of geology and mapping along the way. It\u2019s a story of how continental shifts and volcanic geology came together to form a place for a group of people to call home. \n\nCheck out an extended look at the interviews in this video: https://youtu.be/YIOon-drZhE\n\nWe got to talk with a lot of experts along the way to make this piece. Here are links to some of their work:\n\nHere is some of Michel J\u00e9brak\u2019s research on the Richat structure: https://www.researchgate.net/publication/32048440_Resolving_the_Richat_enigma_Doming_and_hydrothermal_karstification_above_an_alkaline_complex\n\nHere is Ndivhuwo Cecilia Mukosi\u2019s original paper on the Ambohiby Complex: https://www.researchgate.net/publication/318723814_Petrogenesis_of_the_Ambohiby_Complex_Madagascar_and_the_role_of_the_Marion_Hotspot_plume\n\nWe also spoke with Stian Rice, author of Famine in the Remaking, who helped us understand more about the history of agriculture in Madagascar:  https://gjia.georgetown.edu/2022/01/24/madagascars-famine-is-more-than-climate-change/\n\nCheck out Stian\u2019s book on famine and food systems: https://wvupressonline.com/node/831\n\nNorman Thomas Uphoff at Cornell\u2019s SRI International Network also shared more about agricultural systems and innovation: http://sri.ciifad.cornell.edu/\n\nCorrection: At 2:52, we mistakenly labeled Lucienne Wilm\u00e9 as a professor of geology at the University of Florida. In fact, she is a national coordinator of the Madagascar Program at the World Resources Institute. \n\nVox.com is a news website that helps you cut through the noise and understand what's really driving the events in the headlines.

The secret to Nazar\u00e9\u2019s giant waves lies under the surface, where a huge underwater canyon funnels swells right up to its cliffs, then launches that energy straight up, sometimes 60, 70, or 80 feet. Many surfers visit in the hopes of catching a 100-foot wave. \n\nMake sure you never miss behind the scenes content in the Vox Video newsletter, sign up here: http://vox.com/video-newsletter\n\nVox.com is a news website that helps you cut through the noise and understand what's really driving the events in the headlines.

Once they were there, no one was thinking about who got the best wave, the best clip...no one even cared about watching the clips at night.

Kiah, Tate, and Chad had a blast training with Haiden Deegan, learning as they watched the young motocross star prep for the past weekend at Southwick. It's always a great experience for the kiddos watching a kid like Haiden ride, as they see the hard part of the sport before the fun day of racing! \ud83e\udd19\ud83c\udffc\n\nWelcome to TwoTwoTV! We're the Reeds. Chad Reed is a multi-time supercross and motocross champion and the record holder for the most main event starts in AMA supercross history, with 265 starts! Ironically when Chad retired from racing, the kids decided to start. It\u2019s a full circle movement for the Reed family. Join us as we navigate retirement and also starting again. We bring you on the journey as our kids learn with Chad and Ellie. Taking a fresh approach to coaching and learning with a major focus on fundamentals and solid foundations. Our hope is the viewers can also learn and be inspired as the kids strive for their own success in this great sport.

                    "description": "Watch Taylor Swift play \"The Man\", \"Lover\", \"Death by a Thousand Cuts\" and \"All Too Well\" at the Tiny Desk.\n\nMore from NPR Music: \nTiny Desk Concerts: https://www.npr.org/tinydesk\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/nprmusic\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/nprmusic\n\n\nOct. 15, 2019 | Lyndsey McKenna -- As Taylor Swift settled in for her Tiny Desk, she looked out at the 300-plus NPR employees and guests. \"Wow! This is a lot of people in a tiny office!\" she said. \"I love it!\" Then, after introducing herself, she explained her objective: \"I just decided to take this as an opportunity to show you guys how the songs sounded when I first wrote them.\"\n\nIt should come as no surprise that someone who commands stadium stages could hold court in NPR Music's corner of our Washington, D.C., office \u2014 specifically, behind Bob Boilen's desk \u2014 but Swift was truly at home in stripped-down, solo-session mode. (\"It's just me. There's no dancers, unfortunately,\" she quipped.)\n\nOpening with an acoustic rendition of \"The Man,\" from her 2019 album, Lover, Swift delivered a critique of gender double standards with a sense of humor (and a perfectly deployed hair toss), Leonardo DiCaprio name check and all. Turning to the piano with a smile for Lover's title track, she explained the guitar-string scars of the song's bridge. Picking up the guitar again for \"Death by a Thousand Cuts,\" Swift confronted a question that she says has haunted her career: What will you ever do if you get happy? Across the song's run-on thoughts and relentless searching, Swift offered an answer: She'll continue to excel at crafting superb story-songs.\n\nThough most Tiny Desk concerts stop at three songs, we couldn't turn down the chance to hear \"All Too Well\" from Swift's 2012 album, Red. Routinely cited by critics and fans alike as a favorite, the beloved track has become the stuff of Swiftie legends, striking in its specificity (that scarf!) and relatable in a way that anyone who has loved and lost can understand.\n\nThat sense of connection is at the heart of it all. Some 800 Tiny Desk concerts since we published our very first back in April 2008, the aim remains the same: In the midst of meetings and conference calls, Tiny Desk concerts offer respite from the workday and opportunities to see artists reimagine their work in a strange setting. It's always special, but on some days, it feels downright magical. Watching Taylor Swift perform \u2014 and then interact with co-workers and guests who have grown up with her \u2014 was simply enchanting.\n\nSET LIST\n\"The Man\"\n\"Lover\"\n\"Death by a Thousand Cuts\"\n\"All Too Well\"\n\nMUSICIAN\nTaylor Swift: vocals, guitar, piano\n\nCREDITS\nProducers: Bob Boilen, Morgan Noelle Smith; Creative Director: Bob Boilen; Audio Engineers: Josh Rogosin, Natasha Branch; Videographers: Morgan Noelle Smith, Kara Frame, Maia Stern; Associate Producer: Bobby Carter; Production Assistants: Jack Corbett, Mito Habe-Evans; Executive Producer: Lauren Onkey; Senior VP, Programming: Anya Grundmann; Photo: Bob Boilen/NPR",

But when you watch his set from behind Bob Boilen's desk, you'd never suspect any discomfort.\n\nBacked by his touring band, Styles performed several songs from his latest solo album, Fine Line. Between tracks, he talked about the process of writing these songs: From the day off in Nashville that led to \"Watermelon Sugar,\" to the feeling of lovesickness he tried to capture in \"Adore You.\" The camaraderie between the band was clear; and Styles was in on the joy, twirling in his seat between verses.\n\nStyles might not necessarily be the first name that comes to mind when you think of public radio's only working, desk-music-discovery platform. After all, he's got a wildly devoted fanbase that's followed his every move since his One Direction days. In fact, before soundcheck had even started, a crowd of fans had begun to gather outside NPR HQ. They rightly suspected he would be playing a Tiny Desk concert after word got out that the former One Directioner was spotted in D.C. with no tour date on his public schedule.\n\nBut beyond the headlines, Styles has proven to be an artist who takes his songcraft and aesthetic seriously, interested in subverting expectations of what a pop star can and should sound like in 2020. That sense of unpretentious creativity is exactly what he brought to his Tiny Desk performance \u2013 and it definitely earned him some new adoring public radio fans in the process.\n\n\"I have to come into NPR more often,\" Styles said after he and his band played their first song. \"It's nice here.\"\n\nWe \u2014 and our massive crowd of colleagues \u2014 couldn't agree more.\n\nSET LIST\n\"Cherry\"\n\"Watermelon Sugar\"\n\"To Be So Lonely\"\n\"Adore You\"\n\nMUSICIANS\nHarry Styles: vocals, guitar; Sarah Jones: drums, vocals; Mitch Rowland: guitar; Adam Prendergast: bass, vocals; Ny Oh: guitar, vocals; Charlotte Clark: piano, Wurlitzer, guitar, vocals\n\nCREDITS\nProducers: Robin Hilton, Morgan Noelle Smith; Creative director: Bob Boilen; Audio engineers: Josh Rogosin, James Willetts; Videographers: Kara Frame, CJ Riculan, Melany Rochester, Morgan Noelle Smith; Associate Producer: Bobby Carter; Production Assistant: Shanti Hands; Executive producer: Lauren Onkey; VP, programming: Anya Grundmann; Photo: Max Posner/NPR",
