                    "description": "The world is continuing to learn more about the UFO UAP phenomenon. Here, veteran investigative journalist Ross Coulthart sits down for an extended interview with Professor Garry Nolan. Subscribe and set \ud83d\udd14 \u00bb https://7news.link/YTSubscribe\n\nThis interview, recorded in June 2022, with Professor Garry Nolan - one of those precocious minds that when you meet them  you know you're in the presence of someone remarkable, with incredible intelligence. He's a Stanford  University-based professor of immunology, and a nominee for a Nobel prize. He's one of the most reputable immunologists on the planet and is extremely well regarded.\nProfessor Nolan has since become Chairman of the Sol Foundation - a new organisation set up to advocate for scientific investigation of UAPs. \nProfessor Nolan has multiple patents, huge numbers of papers that have been published in his name, and has two companies listed on the Nasdaq, because of successful inventions that he's made. As Ross says, \"he's just all around a complete total overachiever\". \n\"One of the things that I loved in meeting him  was his candor. He's very fast becoming  one of the public faces of UFO UAP commentary. He's decided to take a very public profile  because he's actually an experiencer himself, so when I asked him about the significance of the us  government's admissions that have been made about UAps in the last 12 months, I was quite shocked  and surprised at what he told me.\"\n\nFollow Ross Coulthart for more:\nhttps://www.rosscoulthart.com/ \nhttps://twitter.com/rosscoulthart\nhttps://needtoknow.today/ \n\nFollow Professor Garry Nolan\nhttps://twitter.com/GarryPNolan\nhttps://med.stanford.edu/profiles/garry-nolan\n\nMore information on the Sol Foundation\nhttps://thesolfoundation.org/ \n\n\nKEY CHAPTERS IN THIS VIDEO:\n1:30 What we know for sure about UAPs\n4:20 What is \"it\"?\n5:50 On Lue Elizondo and the extraterrestrial explanation\n6:38 Message to skeptics\n8:30 Professor Nolan's studies into pilots\n10:48 Professor Nolan on the Council Bluffs Iowa event\n14:40 Analysing Bismuth Magnesium material\n17:20 Is the US Government in possession of UAP materials?\n20:00 Pine Gap in Australia, and whether China or Russia know more about UAPs\n24:25 Why is there still a stigma?\n26:35 The Wow!

Here, veteran investigative journalist Ross Coulthart sits down for an extended interview with Professor Garry Nolan. Subscribe and set \ud83d\udd14 \u00bb https://7news.link/YTSubscribe\n\nThis interview, recorded in June 2022, with Professor Garry Nolan - one of those precocious minds that when you meet them  you know you're in the presence of someone remarkable, with incredible intelligence. He's a Stanford  University-based professor of immunology, and a nominee for a Nobel prize. He's one of the most reputable immunologists on the planet and is extremely well regarded.\nProfessor Nolan has since become Chairman of the Sol Foundation - a new organisation set up to advocate for scientific investigation of UAPs. \nProfessor Nolan has multiple patents, huge numbers of papers that have been published in his name, and has two companies listed on the Nasdaq, because of successful inventions that he's made. As Ross says, \"he's just all around a complete total overachiever\". \n\"One of the things that I loved in meeting him  was his candor. He's very fast becoming  one of the public faces of UFO UAP commentary. He's decided to take a very public profile  because he's actually an experiencer himself, so when I asked him about the significance of the us  government's admissions that have been made about UAps in the last 12 months, I was quite shocked  and surprised at what he told me.\"\n\nFollow Ross Coulthart for more:\nhttps://www.rosscoulthart.com/ \nhttps://twitter.com/rosscoulthart\nhttps://needtoknow.today/ \n\nFollow Professor Garry Nolan\nhttps://twitter.com/GarryPNolan\nhttps://med.stanford.edu/profiles/garry-nolan\n\nMore information on the Sol Foundation\nhttps://thesolfoundation.org/ \n\n\nKEY CHAPTERS IN THIS VIDEO:\n1:30 What we know for sure about UAPs\n4:20 What is \"it\"?\n5:50 On Lue Elizondo and the extraterrestrial explanation\n6:38 Message to skeptics\n8:30 Professor Nolan's studies into pilots\n10:48 Professor Nolan on the Council Bluffs Iowa event\n14:40 Analysing Bismuth Magnesium material\n17:20 Is the US Government in possession of UAP materials?\n20:00 Pine Gap in Australia, and whether China or Russia know more about UAPs\n24:25 Why is there still a stigma?\n26:35 The Wow!

                    "description": "How will quantum computing change the world? Neil deGrasse Tyson and comedian Chuck Nice learn about the development of quantum computing and what it means for humanity with theoretical physicist Michio Kaku. \n\nWhat will quantum computing do beyond regular computing? Find out about the race to create the first all-purpose quantum computer and Michio\u2019s book, Quantum Supremacy: How the Quantum Computer Revolution Will Change Everything. Discover quantum bits and how quantum computing breaks from binary. How will we use quantum computers in astrophysics? We explore disaster scenarios and how quantum computing could help us predict coronal mass ejections. \n\nWhere is quantum computing currently? We discuss brain mapping and whether quantum computers could be used as transporters. Plus, learn what it's like to work in string theory and how Michio got his start. Would it be possible to create instant interstellar communication using quantum entanglement? \n\nLearn how quantum entanglement works and why it would be hard to send a message faster than the speed of light. Could quantum computing solve infinity? What is spacetime foam? What forces cause the strings in string theory to vibrate? All that, plus, what comes AFTER quantum computing? \n\nThanks to our Patrons Nickolas Godlove, Recreational Ninja, Micheal Walcott, John Z, Joel Cruz, and Laert Pasko for supporting us this week.\n\nNOTE: StarTalk+ Patrons can watch or listen to this entire episode commercial-free.\n\nGet the NEW Cosmic Queries book (5/5 \u2b50s on Amazon!): https://amzn.to/3dYIEQF\n\nSupport us on Patreon: https://www.patreon.com/startalkradio\n\nFOLLOW or SUBSCRIBE to StarTalk:\nTwitter: http://twitter.com/startalkradio\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/StarTalk\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/startalk\n\nAbout StarTalk: \nScience meets pop culture on StarTalk!

                        "description": "How will quantum computing change the world? Neil deGrasse Tyson and comedian Chuck Nice learn about the development of quantum computing and what it means for humanity with theoretical physicist Michio Kaku. \n\nWhat will quantum computing do beyond regular computing? Find out about the race to create the first all-purpose quantum computer and Michio\u2019s book, Quantum Supremacy: How the Quantum Computer Revolution Will Change Everything. Discover quantum bits and how quantum computing breaks from binary. How will we use quantum computers in astrophysics? We explore disaster scenarios and how quantum computing could help us predict coronal mass ejections. \n\nWhere is quantum computing currently? We discuss brain mapping and whether quantum computers could be used as transporters. Plus, learn what it's like to work in string theory and how Michio got his start. Would it be possible to create instant interstellar communication using quantum entanglement? \n\nLearn how quantum entanglement works and why it would be hard to send a message faster than the speed of light. Could quantum computing solve infinity? What is spacetime foam? What forces cause the strings in string theory to vibrate? All that, plus, what comes AFTER quantum computing? \n\nThanks to our Patrons Nickolas Godlove, Recreational Ninja, Micheal Walcott, John Z, Joel Cruz, and Laert Pasko for supporting us this week.\n\nNOTE: StarTalk+ Patrons can watch or listen to this entire episode commercial-free.\n\nGet the NEW Cosmic Queries book (5/5 \u2b50s on Amazon!): https://amzn.to/3dYIEQF\n\nSupport us on Patreon: https://www.patreon.com/startalkradio\n\nFOLLOW or SUBSCRIBE to StarTalk:\nTwitter: http://twitter.com/startalkradio\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/StarTalk\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/startalk\n\nAbout StarTalk: \nScience meets pop culture on StarTalk!

The Storytelling of Science features a panel of esteemed scientists, public intellectuals, and award-winning writers including well-known science educator Bill Nye, astrophysicist Neil deGrasse Tyson, evolutionary biologist Richard Dawkins, theoretical physicist Brian Greene, Science Friday's Ira Flatow, popular science fiction writer Neal Stephenson, executive director of the World Science Festival Tracy Day, and Origins Project director Lawrence Krauss as they discuss the stories behind cutting edge science from the origin of the universe to a discussion of exciting technologies that will change our future. They demonstrate how to convey the excitement of science and the importance helping promote a public understanding of science.\n\nVideo by Black Chalk Productions\n\nGet the most recent updates from the Origins Project by following us on Facebook /ASUOriginsProject and Twitter @asuORIGINS.

                    "description": "Watch the 2020 Isaac Asimov Memorial Debate on Alien Life: https://youtu.be/xgESzc3hc2U\n\nThe concept of nothing is as old as zero itself. How do we grapple with the concept of nothing? From the best laboratory vacuums on Earth to the vacuum of space to what lies beyond, the idea of nothing continues to intrigue professionals and the public alike.\n\nJoin moderator and Hayden Planetarium Director Neil deGrasse Tyson as he leads a spirited discussion with a group of physicists, philosophers and journalists about the existence of nothing. The event, which was streamed live to the web, took place at the American Museum of Natural History on March 20, 2013.\n\nPANELISTS:\n\nJ. Richard Gott, professor of astrophysical sciences, Princeton University, and author of Sizing Up the Universe: The Cosmos in Perspective\n\nJim Holt, science journalist and author of Why Does the World Exist?

Neil deGrasse Tyson and comedian Matt Kirshen learn about exoplanet discovery on the frontier, how higher oxygen gave us dinosaurs, and what type of life could evolve on alien worlds with astrophysicist and astrobiologist Lisa Kaltenegger. \n\nLisa tells us about breaking down the chemical signature of newfound rocky planets. When will we have telescopes that will see the surface of these exoplanets? If an alien on a different planet pointed a telescope at us, what signs of life would they see? Is there anything they could mistake us for? We explore how geology creates complicated atmospheres and of course the question: what is life? \n\nCould life have landed here on a meteorite and blended in with other life on Earth? We discuss the universality of biology: do the rules of biology apply everywhere? How hard is life to get rid of once it's started? How fast could life evolve on another world? Plus, learn how Earth's oxygen levels contributed to the Jurassic period. We explore extremophiles and whether life could live on asteroids, icy moons, and large rocky planets: Super-Earths. What conditions trigger complex life? \n\nDid human life come from panspermia? Find out about chirality and why we think that all Earth life started from the same source. Why do people really want to think we came from space? We talk about dimethyl sulfur as a biomarker and why its discovery on a Super-Earth may be both promising and potentially misleading.

Neil deGrasse Tyson and comedian Chuck Nice answer fan questions about stillness, humans on Mars, and what songs they would add to the Voyager Golden Record. \n\nWould we be stronger and faster on Mars? We talk about what it would be like to construct buildings on Mars and why the largest creature on Earth is a whale. If you fell through a hole through the center of the Earth, what would happen? Where would you pop out based on where you started? \n\nNeil and Chuck share what songs they would add to the Voyager Golden Record to update it. Is there such a thing as absolute stillness in the universe? Learn about Lord Kelvin and absolute zero. Can we actually tell if an object is stationary relative to one in motion? Plus, we talk about the spaghettification of quarks and whether a black hole would eat itself. \n\nWe explore the role of free speech in future human space settlements. Could it be beneficial to manage or censor media while establishing a colony? Are spiral galaxies getting sucked into a black hole? How do they maintain their iconic spiral shape? Find out about spiral density waves and accretion disks. \n\nThanks to our Patrons Scott Nelson, Bj\u00f8rn Furuknap, Paul Robinson, Jonasz Napiecek, Micheal Briggs, Blake Wolfe, Brett Maragno, Adam Stephensen, Cicero Artefon, and Paul Lesperance for supporting us this week.\n\nNOTE: StarTalk+ Patrons can listen to this entire episode commercial-free.\n\nTimestamps:\n00:00 - Introduction: Grab Bag\n1:17 - Would You Be Stronger on Mars? \n7:38 - Falling Through the Center of the Earth\n17:57 - Neil & Chuck\u2019s Golden Record\n22:30 - Is It Possible for Something to Be Absolutely Still? \n27:02 - Spaghettifying Quarks\n29:34 - Censorship on Space Colonies\n35:04 - Spiral Galaxy Structure\n\nCheck out our second channel, @StarTalkPlus\n\nGet the NEW StarTalk book, 'To Infinity and Beyond: A Journey of Cosmic Discovery' on Amazon: https://amzn.to/3PL0NFn\n\nSupport us on Patreon: https://www.patreon.com/startalkradio\n\nFOLLOW or SUBSCRIBE to StarTalk:\nTwitter: http://twitter.com/startalkradio\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/StarTalk\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/startalk\n\nAbout StarTalk: \nScience meets pop culture on StarTalk!

                        "description": "Is there anything in the universe that is not moving? Neil deGrasse Tyson and comedian Chuck Nice answer fan questions about stillness, humans on Mars, and what songs they would add to the Voyager Golden Record. \n\nWould we be stronger and faster on Mars? We talk about what it would be like to construct buildings on Mars and why the largest creature on Earth is a whale. If you fell through a hole through the center of the Earth, what would happen? Where would you pop out based on where you started? \n\nNeil and Chuck share what songs they would add to the Voyager Golden Record to update it. Is there such a thing as absolute stillness in the universe? Learn about Lord Kelvin and absolute zero. Can we actually tell if an object is stationary relative to one in motion? Plus, we talk about the spaghettification of quarks and whether a black hole would eat itself. \n\nWe explore the role of free speech in future human space settlements. Could it be beneficial to manage or censor media while establishing a colony? Are spiral galaxies getting sucked into a black hole? How do they maintain their iconic spiral shape? Find out about spiral density waves and accretion disks. \n\nThanks to our Patrons Scott Nelson, Bj\u00f8rn Furuknap, Paul Robinson, Jonasz Napiecek, Micheal Briggs, Blake Wolfe, Brett Maragno, Adam Stephensen, Cicero Artefon, and Paul Lesperance for supporting us this week.\n\nNOTE: StarTalk+ Patrons can listen to this entire episode commercial-free.\n\nTimestamps:\n00:00 - Introduction: Grab Bag\n1:17 - Would You Be Stronger on Mars? \n7:38 - Falling Through the Center of the Earth\n17:57 - Neil & Chuck\u2019s Golden Record\n22:30 - Is It Possible for Something to Be Absolutely Still? \n27:02 - Spaghettifying Quarks\n29:34 - Censorship on Space Colonies\n35:04 - Spiral Galaxy Structure\n\nCheck out our second channel, @StarTalkPlus\n\nGet the NEW StarTalk book, 'To Infinity and Beyond: A Journey of Cosmic Discovery' on Amazon: https://amzn.to/3PL0NFn\n\nSupport us on Patreon: https://www.patreon.com/startalkradio\n\nFOLLOW or SUBSCRIBE to StarTalk:\nTwitter: http://twitter.com/startalkradio\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/StarTalk\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/startalk\n\nAbout StarTalk: \nScience meets pop culture on StarTalk!

Learn about how neurons self-organize, embodied networks, and how to help computers understand the real world. We explore whether AGI can be achieved with \u201cwetware\u201d or with silicon-based hardware. We talk about what animals do well computationally and how long it takes for a neural network to learn how to play Pong. How do information systems work on a fundamental level? \n\nLearn about The Free Energy Principle and how scientists utilize entropy to train neural networks. How do you gauge intelligence in a system? What are the ethics of creating a biological form of intelligence? We discuss whether a biological AGI could develop consciousness and the difference between consciousness and intelligence. Should we be recreating the human brain? \n\nCould a complex neural system lead to consciousness? We discuss the future of computing: could it be the combination of silicon and biological processing? How will biological computers solve problems differently? Find out about applications for this research and whether all neurons are the same.

                    "description": "Are humans smart enough to uncover the secrets of the universe? Neil deGrasse Tyson and comedian Chuck Nice explore the singularity, string theory, free will and more with theoretical physicist Brian Greene. \n\nDoes quantum mechanics prevent an infinitely small singularity in a black hole if nothing can be smaller than a Planck length? Explore with us the mathematical breakdown at the singularity and what we know about what goes on there. Can relativity and quantum mechanics ever truly meet? \n\nWe discuss if anything in our universe truly has free will. What is free will to a photon that does not perceive time? We discuss the role of aesthetics in theoretical physics, whether string theory is right, and why it's taking so long to uncover the entire universe. \n\nHow is E = mc^2 actually used? We break down the mass-energy equivalence and how it is demonstrated in everyday life. What would a scaled-up atom look like? Is there a geometric center of the universe? Will we ever reach a point where quantum physics can no longer be proven experimentally? All that, plus, we explore what the next major breakthrough might be and whether it will shatter our understanding of the universe as we know it.\n\nThanks to our Patrons Christian Attwood, Tyler Loveland, Ruhan Periyacheri, Jeff Parker, Ed Thorton, and Dakota Ponder for supporting us this week.\n\nNOTE: StarTalk+ Patrons can listen to this entire episode commercial-free\n\nGet the NEW StarTalk book, 'To Infinity and Beyond: A Journey of Cosmic Discovery' on Amazon: https://amzn.to/3PL0NFn\n\nSupport us on Patreon: https://www.patreon.com/startalkradio\n\nFOLLOW or SUBSCRIBE to StarTalk:\nTwitter: http://twitter.com/startalkradio\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/StarTalk\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/startalk\n\nAbout StarTalk: \nScience meets pop culture on StarTalk!

Neil deGrasse Tyson and comedian Chuck Nice explore the singularity, string theory, free will and more with theoretical physicist Brian Greene. \n\nDoes quantum mechanics prevent an infinitely small singularity in a black hole if nothing can be smaller than a Planck length? Explore with us the mathematical breakdown at the singularity and what we know about what goes on there. Can relativity and quantum mechanics ever truly meet? \n\nWe discuss if anything in our universe truly has free will. What is free will to a photon that does not perceive time? We discuss the role of aesthetics in theoretical physics, whether string theory is right, and why it's taking so long to uncover the entire universe. \n\nHow is E = mc^2 actually used? We break down the mass-energy equivalence and how it is demonstrated in everyday life. What would a scaled-up atom look like? Is there a geometric center of the universe? Will we ever reach a point where quantum physics can no longer be proven experimentally? All that, plus, we explore what the next major breakthrough might be and whether it will shatter our understanding of the universe as we know it.\n\nThanks to our Patrons Christian Attwood, Tyler Loveland, Ruhan Periyacheri, Jeff Parker, Ed Thorton, and Dakota Ponder for supporting us this week.\n\nNOTE: StarTalk+ Patrons can listen to this entire episode commercial-free\n\nGet the NEW StarTalk book, 'To Infinity and Beyond: A Journey of Cosmic Discovery' on Amazon: https://amzn.to/3PL0NFn\n\nSupport us on Patreon: https://www.patreon.com/startalkradio\n\nFOLLOW or SUBSCRIBE to StarTalk:\nTwitter: http://twitter.com/startalkradio\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/StarTalk\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/startalk\n\nAbout StarTalk: \nScience meets pop culture on StarTalk!

Your red snapper could actually be a tilapia fillet. That wild-caught salmon? It could be farm-raised. Crab, lobster, and scallops have also been victims of fraudulent swaps \u2014 some of the substitutions could harm human health.

                        "description": "According to the ocean-conservation nonprofit Oceana, seafood may be one of the most commonly fraudulent foods we come in contact with. Your red snapper could actually be a tilapia fillet. That wild-caught salmon? It could be farm-raised. Crab, lobster, and scallops have also been victims of fraudulent swaps \u2014 some of the substitutions could harm human health. But there are also entire criminal rings smuggling seafood across the world. They often fish illegally and have been involved in human trafficking. Why is it so hard to catch bad actors in seafood supply chains? And how can we ensure we're getting the seafood on the label?\n\n00:00 - Intro\n01:15 - Crab\n04:24 - Tuna\n08:32 - Scallops\n10:44 - Salmon\n14:07 - Red Snapper\n16:12 - Lobster\n19:16 - Caviar\n21:57 - How Seafood Crime Works\n28:29 - Credits\n\nMORE BIG BUSINESS VIDEOS:\nCan India's 'Drink of The Poor' Win Over Elites And The Global Alcohol Market? | Big Business\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnuVykT0CT4\nHow To Prep Kentucky Derby\u00ae Horses For Race Day | Big Business | Business Insider\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwNogMdG5dk\nHow America's Largest Buffet Survived The Death Of All-You-Can-Eats | Big Business\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TXg1mYN2tbw\n\n------------------------------------------------------\n#seafood #food #businessinsider \n\nBusiness Insider tells you all you need to know about business, finance, tech, retail, and more.\n\nVisit our homepage for the top stories of the day: https://www.businessinsider.com\nBusiness Insider on Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/businessinsider Business Insider on Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/insiderbusiness Business Insider on Twitter: https://www.twitter.com/businessinsider \nBusiness Insider on Snapchat: https://www.snapchat.com/discover/Business_Insider/5319643143\nBusiness Insider on TikTok: https://www.tiktok.com/@businessinsider\n\n7 Of The Most Faked Seafoods In The World | Big Business | Business Insider"

And your shaker of Parmesan cheese? It probably has wood pulp inside. \n\nYou might feel the companies behind these food products are using deceptive packaging \u2014\u00a0but it's legal. However, there's a whole other level of trickery that's completely illegal: food fraud. That's when criminals bottle up corn syrup and call it 100% honey, or when they pass off cheap mozzarella as pure Parmigiano-Reggiano. \n\nGlobally, the fraudulent food industry could be worth $40 billion. It hurts legitimate producers, funds criminal activities, and can even harm consumers. We head around the world to uncover how producers get away with food deception and how we can spot the real stuff.\n\n0:00 Intro\n1:08 Truffles\n3:44 Maple Syrup\n5:19 Wasabi\n7:42 Parmesan Cheese\n11:15 Vanilla\n12:58 Caviar\n14:40 Honey\n17:30 Olive Oil\n20:04 Wagyu Beef\n22:20 Coffee\n24:05 Saffron\n25:58 How criminals get away with selling fakes\n\nHow A Louisiana Crawfish Company Harvests 60,000 pounds A Day | Big Business | Insider Business\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uo6KRFh0za0\nInside the US Factory Making Ukraine\u2019s Most Important Ammo | Big Business | Insider Business\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRtYyjvYTWk\nWhy Coconut Farmers Risk Their Lives To Feed The World's Superfood Obsession | Big Business\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vEA8HpR_Azw\n\n------------------------------------------------------\n#food #BigBusiness #InsiderBusiness \n\nBusiness Insider tells you all you need to know about business, finance, tech, retail, and more.\n\nVisit our homepage for the top stories of the day: https://www.businessinsider.com\nInsider Business on Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/businessinsider\nInsider Business on Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/insiderbusiness\nInsider Business on Twitter: https://www.twitter.com/businessinsider\nInsider Business on Snapchat: https://www.snapchat.com/discover/Business_Insider/5319643143\nInsider Business on TikTok: https://www.tiktok.com/@businessinsider\n\n11 Of The Most Faked Foods In The World | Big Business | Insider Business",

And your shaker of Parmesan cheese? It probably has wood pulp inside. \n\nYou might feel the companies behind these food products are using deceptive packaging \u2014\u00a0but it's legal. However, there's a whole other level of trickery that's completely illegal: food fraud. That's when criminals bottle up corn syrup and call it 100% honey, or when they pass off cheap mozzarella as pure Parmigiano-Reggiano. \n\nGlobally, the fraudulent food industry could be worth $40 billion. It hurts legitimate producers, funds criminal activities, and can even harm consumers. We head around the world to uncover how producers get away with food deception and how we can spot the real stuff.\n\n0:00 Intro\n1:08 Truffles\n3:44 Maple Syrup\n5:19 Wasabi\n7:42 Parmesan Cheese\n11:15 Vanilla\n12:58 Caviar\n14:40 Honey\n17:30 Olive Oil\n20:04 Wagyu Beef\n22:20 Coffee\n24:05 Saffron\n25:58 How criminals get away with selling fakes\n\nHow A Louisiana Crawfish Company Harvests 60,000 pounds A Day | Big Business | Insider Business\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uo6KRFh0za0\nInside the US Factory Making Ukraine\u2019s Most Important Ammo | Big Business | Insider Business\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRtYyjvYTWk\nWhy Coconut Farmers Risk Their Lives To Feed The World's Superfood Obsession | Big Business\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vEA8HpR_Azw\n\n------------------------------------------------------\n#food #BigBusiness #InsiderBusiness \n\nBusiness Insider tells you all you need to know about business, finance, tech, retail, and more.\n\nVisit our homepage for the top stories of the day: https://www.businessinsider.com\nInsider Business on Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/businessinsider\nInsider Business on Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/insiderbusiness\nInsider Business on Twitter: https://www.twitter.com/businessinsider\nInsider Business on Snapchat: https://www.snapchat.com/discover/Business_Insider/5319643143\nInsider Business on TikTok: https://www.tiktok.com/@businessinsider\n\n11 Of The Most Faked Foods In The World | Big Business | Insider Business"

But swimming has been banned in the Seine for a century because the Paris sewer system is designed to dump wastewater into the river during heavy rain, when the sewers get overwhelmed by stormwater. \n\nWhen that happens, levels of E. coli, a bacteria associated with fecal matter, spike in the river, making it too contaminated to swim in. In order to make good on its promise to clean the river, Paris officials took on a $1.5 billion USD infrastructure project that includes a massive underground tank and tunnel system meant to hold excess sewage during heavy rain and prevent further contamination of the Seine. \n\nWater quality testing will be done daily ahead of the Olympic games this summer, and Paris officials are hopeful their ambitious plan to host swimming in the famously polluted river will succeed. \n\nFollow the daily water quality tests of the Seine from the City of Paris here: \nhttps://www.paris.fr/pages/meteo-de-la-seine-quelle-est-la-qualite-de-l-eau-du-fleuve-27467\n\nCheck out some of the data used in this video, along with additional water quality tests, from Fluidion:\nhttps://fluidion.com/open-data-initiative/2024-seine-water-quality\n\nAre Olympians Going to Swim in Poop Water? \u2013 The Cut\nhttps://www.thecut.com/article/olympics-2024-athletes-swim-unsanitary-seine-river.html\n\nWill the Seine be ready for Olympic swimming?

In order to make good on its promise to clean the river, Paris officials took on a $1.5 billion USD infrastructure project that includes a massive underground tank and tunnel system meant to hold excess sewage during heavy rain and prevent further contamination of the Seine. \n\nWater quality testing will be done daily ahead of the Olympic games this summer, and Paris officials are hopeful their ambitious plan to host swimming in the famously polluted river will succeed. \n\nFollow the daily water quality tests of the Seine from the City of Paris here: \nhttps://www.paris.fr/pages/meteo-de-la-seine-quelle-est-la-qualite-de-l-eau-du-fleuve-27467\n\nCheck out some of the data used in this video, along with additional water quality tests, from Fluidion:\nhttps://fluidion.com/open-data-initiative/2024-seine-water-quality\n\nAre Olympians Going to Swim in Poop Water? \u2013 The Cut\nhttps://www.thecut.com/article/olympics-2024-athletes-swim-unsanitary-seine-river.html\n\nWill the Seine be ready for Olympic swimming?

Join our community\n\u25b6 https://skill-builder.uk/signup \u25c0\n\nLondon Yellow Stock Bricks: A Cornerstone of British Architecture\n\nLondon Yellow Stock bricks are an iconic element of British architecture, particularly in the capital. \n\nTheir distinctive yellowish hue has contributed to the city's architectural identity, shaping the appearance of many historical and contemporary buildings.\n\nLondon Yellow Stock bricks originated in the 18th and 19th centuries and were predominantly used to construct residential and commercial buildings. \n\nThe production of these bricks was closely tied to the clay and chalk-rich subsoils found in the Thames Basin. \n\nThe raw materials' specific geological composition and the unique firing process resulted in bricks with a characteristic yellow colour and varied tones, ranging from pale cream to a deeper buff.\n\nOne of the key factors behind the widespread use of London Yellow Stock bricks was their durability. \n\nThese bricks were fired in traditional clamp kilns, which allowed for a range of temperatures and created a dense and hard-wearing structure. \n\nThis robustness suited them to London's weather conditions, offering excellent resistance to the damp and frost typical of the British climate.\n\nThe aesthetic appeal of London Yellow Stock bricks is another reason for their enduring popularity. \n\nTheir mellow, variegated tones lend a distinctive warmth and texture to buildings, creating a visually appealing contrast with other materials such as red bricks or stone. \n\nThis aesthetic quality has made them a favourite among architects and builders, contributing to their use in numerous notable structures, including Georgian terraces, Victorian townhouses, and various public buildings.\n\nIn addition to their aesthetic and practical qualities, London Yellow Stock bricks have historical significance. \n\nThey are closely associated with the period of rapid urban expansion and industrialisation in London during the 19th century. \n\nMany buildings from this era, including working-class housing, factories, and warehouses, were constructed using these bricks. \n\nAs such, they are an integral part of the city's architectural heritage, reflecting its industrial past and the evolution of its urban landscape.\n\nToday, the demand for London Yellow Stock bricks continues, driven by their historic value and unique appearance. \n\nThey are often used in restoration projects to maintain the authenticity of period properties. \n\nModern manufacturing techniques have also produced new bricks that replicate the traditional look and feel, ensuring their continued relevance in contemporary architecture.\n\nThe enduring appeal of London Yellow Stock bricks lies in their practicality, aesthetic charm, and historical significance. \n\nThey are more than just a building material; they symbolise London's architectural heritage, embodying the city's history and contributing to its unique urban character. \n\nWhether in old Victorian houses or modern restorations, these bricks are a testament to traditional craftsmanship's timeless quality.\n\n\n==========================================\n#londonwalk #londonarchitecture #building \n\n\ud83d\udcea Newsletter: http://skill-builder.uk/signup\n\nhttps://www.tiktok.com/@skillbuilder\n\nhttps://www.facebook.com/skillbuilderchannel\n\nhttps://www.instagram.com/skill_builder\n\nhttps://twitter.com/skillbuilderuk\n\n\ud83d\udd17 Skill Builder Link Tree: https://linktr.ee/skillbuilder\n\n\ud83d\uded2 As an Amazon Associate, we earn from qualifying purchases\n\n\ud83c\udfac Video library: https://www.youtube.com/skillbuilderchannel/videos\n\n\ud83d\udca7 We Support Charity Water: https://www.charitywater.org\n\n\u25fe Out of respect to our sponsors and followers, we'll remove comments that do not follow expected standards of politeness and decency.",

Join our community\n\u25b6 https://skill-builder.uk/signup \u25c0\n\nLondon Yellow Stock Bricks: A Cornerstone of British Architecture\n\nLondon Yellow Stock bricks are an iconic element of British architecture, particularly in the capital. \n\nTheir distinctive yellowish hue has contributed to the city's architectural identity, shaping the appearance of many historical and contemporary buildings.\n\nLondon Yellow Stock bricks originated in the 18th and 19th centuries and were predominantly used to construct residential and commercial buildings. \n\nThe production of these bricks was closely tied to the clay and chalk-rich subsoils found in the Thames Basin. \n\nThe raw materials' specific geological composition and the unique firing process resulted in bricks with a characteristic yellow colour and varied tones, ranging from pale cream to a deeper buff.\n\nOne of the key factors behind the widespread use of London Yellow Stock bricks was their durability. \n\nThese bricks were fired in traditional clamp kilns, which allowed for a range of temperatures and created a dense and hard-wearing structure. \n\nThis robustness suited them to London's weather conditions, offering excellent resistance to the damp and frost typical of the British climate.\n\nThe aesthetic appeal of London Yellow Stock bricks is another reason for their enduring popularity. \n\nTheir mellow, variegated tones lend a distinctive warmth and texture to buildings, creating a visually appealing contrast with other materials such as red bricks or stone. \n\nThis aesthetic quality has made them a favourite among architects and builders, contributing to their use in numerous notable structures, including Georgian terraces, Victorian townhouses, and various public buildings.\n\nIn addition to their aesthetic and practical qualities, London Yellow Stock bricks have historical significance. \n\nThey are closely associated with the period of rapid urban expansion and industrialisation in London during the 19th century. \n\nMany buildings from this era, including working-class housing, factories, and warehouses, were constructed using these bricks. \n\nAs such, they are an integral part of the city's architectural heritage, reflecting its industrial past and the evolution of its urban landscape.\n\nToday, the demand for London Yellow Stock bricks continues, driven by their historic value and unique appearance. \n\nThey are often used in restoration projects to maintain the authenticity of period properties. \n\nModern manufacturing techniques have also produced new bricks that replicate the traditional look and feel, ensuring their continued relevance in contemporary architecture.\n\nThe enduring appeal of London Yellow Stock bricks lies in their practicality, aesthetic charm, and historical significance. \n\nThey are more than just a building material; they symbolise London's architectural heritage, embodying the city's history and contributing to its unique urban character. \n\nWhether in old Victorian houses or modern restorations, these bricks are a testament to traditional craftsmanship's timeless quality.\n\n\n==========================================\n#londonwalk #londonarchitecture #building \n\n\ud83d\udcea Newsletter: http://skill-builder.uk/signup\n\nhttps://www.tiktok.com/@skillbuilder\n\nhttps://www.facebook.com/skillbuilderchannel\n\nhttps://www.instagram.com/skill_builder\n\nhttps://twitter.com/skillbuilderuk\n\n\ud83d\udd17 Skill Builder Link Tree: https://linktr.ee/skillbuilder\n\n\ud83d\uded2 As an Amazon Associate, we earn from qualifying purchases\n\n\ud83c\udfac Video library: https://www.youtube.com/skillbuilderchannel/videos\n\n\ud83d\udca7 We Support Charity Water: https://www.charitywater.org\n\n\u25fe Out of respect to our sponsors and followers, we'll remove comments that do not follow expected standards of politeness and decency."

                    "description": "#henryviii #tudorhistory #tudorpalace\n\nIn 1698, the Palace of Whitehall, the official residence of the British sovereign, was burnt to the ground in a devastating fire. It was never replaced and very little of it now survives.  In this video, I trace the origin of the palace, a residence stolen from Cardinal Wolsey from Henry VIII, and how Henry VIII and successive Tudor and Stuart sovereigns developed it.  I look at contemporary images of the palace to get some sense of what Henry VIII's lost palace looked like, and then explore what remains of it above and below ground.     \n\nJoin this channel to get access to perks:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCGPU2PD0Zmliah8C9AfhrMQ/join",

                        "description": "#henryviii #tudorhistory #tudorpalace\n\nIn 1698, the Palace of Whitehall, the official residence of the British sovereign, was burnt to the ground in a devastating fire. It was never replaced and very little of it now survives.  In this video, I trace the origin of the palace, a residence stolen from Cardinal Wolsey from Henry VIII, and how Henry VIII and successive Tudor and Stuart sovereigns developed it.  I look at contemporary images of the palace to get some sense of what Henry VIII's lost palace looked like, and then explore what remains of it above and below ground.     \n\nJoin this channel to get access to perks:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCGPU2PD0Zmliah8C9AfhrMQ/join"

This glorious and ancient city was an ancient capital of England and Edward traces back down the years the origins of the Crown via such luminaries as King Alfred, King Edgar, and even King Arthur. More pillage and plunder, more murder and miracle.\n\n24:52 - Brighton & Lewes. A tale of two towns concludes this tour by Edward Windsor through some of England's most historic sites and their connections with the Crown. The regal links between the two towns is in small part due to George IV, but has more to do with some acts of derring-do and tales of wheeling and dealing.\n\nFrom Elizabeth II to Cleopatra, Real Royalty peels back the curtain to give a glimpse into the lives of some of the most influential families in the world, with new full length documentaries posted every week covering the monarchies of today and all throughout history.\n\n\ud83d\udcfa Discover the past on History Hit with ad-free exclusive podcasts and documentaries released weekly presented by world renowned historians Dan Snow, Suzannah Lipscomb, Matt Lewis and more.

He discovers that an ancestor of his was responsible for the first salvage dive below the ocean and learns how the town records for Yarmouth came to be thrown away! He also has a brush with a band of smugglers and visits Osbourne House, the family home of Queen Victoria.\n\n0:24:58 - Edward Windsor goes to Farnborough to find a corner of England that is forever France, and unearths the reason why Aldershot is so strongly linked with the army. We also keep with the military theme by visiting Stratfield Saye, home of the Duke of Wellington, where we find out that Queen Victoria was not amused by the temperature of the house!\n\n0:49:20 - Rochester was famously both the scene of the first Royal abdication and ironically the restoration of the monarchy after Cromwell. Edward Windsor discovers a curious connection between the area's most prolific author Charles Dickens, the naval dockyards at Chatham, and Queen Victoria.\n\n1:13:40 - The flower festival of Corpus Christi provides the backdrop as Edward Windsor investigates one of the oldest hereditary titles in the land, The Earl of Arundel. They are still responsible for organising many of England's grandest state occasions nearly one thousand years after they first held the post!\n\n1:38:02 - Salisbury is an area steeped in myth and legend, from Stonehenge to the top of the spire in Salisbury Cathedral. Edward Windsor follows in the footsteps of his ancestors, and discovers how many Royal connections there are with this beautiful part of the country. We also unearth a forgotten Palace, and find out why a nobleman insisted on smuggling a factory worker to England in a butt of wine!\n\n2:02:20 - In 1174 a few ill-chosen words from Henry II changed the course of history.\n\nFrom Elizabeth II to Cleopatra, Real Royalty peels back the curtain to give a glimpse into the lives of some of the most influential families in the world, with new full length documentaries posted every week covering the monarchies of today and all throughout history.\n\n\ud83d\udcfa Discover the past on History Hit with ad-free exclusive podcasts and documentaries released weekly presented by world renowned historians Dan Snow, Suzannah Lipscomb, Matt Lewis and more.

                        "description": "0:00:03 - Edward Windsor travels overseas for the first in a series of Crown and Country to the Isle of Wight. He discovers that an ancestor of his was responsible for the first salvage dive below the ocean and learns how the town records for Yarmouth came to be thrown away! He also has a brush with a band of smugglers and visits Osbourne House, the family home of Queen Victoria.\n\n0:24:58 - Edward Windsor goes to Farnborough to find a corner of England that is forever France, and unearths the reason why Aldershot is so strongly linked with the army. We also keep with the military theme by visiting Stratfield Saye, home of the Duke of Wellington, where we find out that Queen Victoria was not amused by the temperature of the house!\n\n0:49:20 - Rochester was famously both the scene of the first Royal abdication and ironically the restoration of the monarchy after Cromwell. Edward Windsor discovers a curious connection between the area's most prolific author Charles Dickens, the naval dockyards at Chatham, and Queen Victoria.\n\n1:13:40 - The flower festival of Corpus Christi provides the backdrop as Edward Windsor investigates one of the oldest hereditary titles in the land, The Earl of Arundel. They are still responsible for organising many of England's grandest state occasions nearly one thousand years after they first held the post!\n\n1:38:02 - Salisbury is an area steeped in myth and legend, from Stonehenge to the top of the spire in Salisbury Cathedral. Edward Windsor follows in the footsteps of his ancestors, and discovers how many Royal connections there are with this beautiful part of the country. We also unearth a forgotten Palace, and find out why a nobleman insisted on smuggling a factory worker to England in a butt of wine!\n\n2:02:20 - In 1174 a few ill-chosen words from Henry II changed the course of history.\n\nFrom Elizabeth II to Cleopatra, Real Royalty peels back the curtain to give a glimpse into the lives of some of the most influential families in the world, with new full length documentaries posted every week covering the monarchies of today and all throughout history.\n\n\ud83d\udcfa Discover the past on History Hit with ad-free exclusive podcasts and documentaries released weekly presented by world renowned historians Dan Snow, Suzannah Lipscomb, Matt Lewis and more.
