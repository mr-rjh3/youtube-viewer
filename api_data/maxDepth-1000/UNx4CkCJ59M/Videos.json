                        "description": "In the seventh instalment of the Texas trip, I'm paying a visit to Max & Louie's New York Diner in San Antonio to take on their 'Robert Stack Challenge', which it turns out is named after the American character actor and sportsman of the same name...yeah I know, I've never heard of him either...\n\nParticipants get 25 minutes in which to eat a stack of pancakes, waffles, french toast, bacon, eggs, sausage, chicken and somewhat bizarrely...a slice of orange...in order to win the meal free, a swanky tee and even a mug, provided you can box off a dessert too!\n\n***NEW VIDEOS EVERY THURSDAY AND SUNDAY AT 7PM UK TIME***\n\nFOLLOW ME: Facebook/Twitter/Instagram: @BeardMeatsFood\n\nFOLLOW MRS BEARD: Instagram: @Mrs_Beard_Eats\n\nMY PODCAST:\n\n@BreakingBreadPD - A good old fashioned chin wag with my co-host Josh Gudgeon, in a studio that looks so plush it makes it look like we know what we're doing.\n\nMERCHANDISE (DISTRIBUTED BY TEESPRING): \n\nUse the merchandise shelf above or the following link - https://teespring.com/en-GB/stores/beard-meats-food-store\n\nANSWERS TO COMMON QUESTIONS & ADDITIONAL INFO:\n\nQ: How come you don\u2019t get fat? \nA: I eat like this for 1 hour of a 168 hour long week. In simple terms, I eat at caloric maintenance over the course of time, meaning I don\u2019t gain weight. If you're interested in learning more, see the \u2018But How Come You're Not Fat' and 'It Was Just A Normal Day...' videos available on my channel.\n\nQ: Don\u2019t you worry about your health?\nA: Not in particular. I\u2019m active. I eat nutrient dense foods five days a week. And, I get quarterly bloods done, amongst other health checks.\n\nBIOGRAPHY, COMMON QUESTION\u2019S AND TRIVIA:\n\nSee IMDB profile - https://www.imdb.com/name/nm8467462/bio\n\nMusic credits to my mate FLORIAN HAACK for the incredible video game metal covers!\n\n#FoodChallenge #Texas #SanAntonio"

They offer a remarkable glimpse into the life of a \"dollar bride\" during the Gilded Age, shedding light on both triumphs and struggles.\n \nThe exhibition takes innovation to the next level by introducing Alberta AI, a ground-breaking creation that brings her story to life like never before. \n\n\u201cWith the aid of cutting-edge AI technology, we've resurrected Alberta's voice, allowing her to answer visitors\u2019 burning questions about her remarkable journey,\u201d says Julie Montagu, Viscountess Hinchingbrooke.\n\n\ud83c\udfdb\ufe0f Can't come visit us in person!

However,  if you can\u2019t make it in person you can buy a ticket (3 cups of coffee) for a virtual hour long tour with me, and support this ongoing project over at https://www.buymeacoffee.com/juliejmontagu\n\nA new exhibition offers a glimpse into the captivating world of Alberta Sturges Montagu, the 9th Countess of Sandwich, and an American Heiress from the renowned era known as The Gilded Age. \n\nCurated by Mapperton\u2019s very own American Viscountess, Julie Montagu, the \"American Heiress\" collection is comprised of more than 10,000 previously unseen letters exchanged between Alberta (Sturges) Montagu and her family, as well as the peerage at large. \n\nDating from 1888 to 1951, these letters constitute the largest unpublished private collection of correspondence from the period. They offer a remarkable glimpse into the life of a \"dollar bride\" during the Gilded Age, shedding light on both triumphs and struggles.\n \nThe exhibition takes innovation to the next level by introducing Alberta AI, a ground-breaking creation that brings her story to life like never before. \n\n\u201cWith the aid of cutting-edge AI technology, we've resurrected Alberta's voice, allowing her to answer visitors\u2019 burning questions about her remarkable journey,\u201d says Julie Montagu, Viscountess Hinchingbrooke.\n\n\ud83c\udfdb\ufe0f Can't come visit us in person!

They offer a remarkable glimpse into the life of a \"dollar bride\" during the Gilded Age, shedding light on both triumphs and struggles.\n \nThe exhibition takes innovation to the next level by introducing Alberta AI, a ground-breaking creation that brings her story to life like never before. \n\n\u201cWith the aid of cutting-edge AI technology, we've resurrected Alberta's voice, allowing her to answer visitors\u2019 burning questions about her remarkable journey,\u201d says Julie Montagu, Viscountess Hinchingbrooke.\n\n\ud83c\udfdb\ufe0f Can't come visit us in person!

They offer a remarkable glimpse into the life of a \"dollar bride\" during the Gilded Age, shedding light on both triumphs and struggles.\n \nThe exhibition will explore Alberta's formative years in America, her upbringing in Chicago and New York, and the significance of her inheritance. Visitors will unravel the captivating courtship between Alberta and George Montagu, the future 9th Earl of Sandwich, leading to their marriage in 1905 in London. The narrative will culminate with her relocation to Hinchingbrooke House, the original family seat, in 1916 as the new Countess, following the death of the 8th Earl of Sandwich.\n\nThe exhibition takes innovation to the next level by introducing Alberta AI, a ground-breaking creation that brings her story to life like never before. \n\n\u201cWith the aid of cutting-edge AI technology, we've resurrected Alberta's voice, allowing her to answer visitors\u2019 burning questions about her remarkable journey,\u201d says Julie Montagu, Viscountess Hinchingbrooke.\n\n\ud83c\udfdb\ufe0f Can't come visit us in person!

                    "description": "Married Life - Are we weird?// Hello! I wanted to make a different kind of vlog - a very unpolished and raw vlog of Joerg and me. It's just us living our life and yes, we've been together for 30 years at the end of this month. Joerg isn't only my husband, he's my partner in crime and my best friend. Our life has always been adventurous, weird at times but we wouldn't want it any other way. And your feedback on this one would mean so much to me/us. Would you like to see more of these vlogs? A mixture of both polished and then very real vlogs? Your comments are highly appreciated.x\n\n_____\n\nRECIPE GLUTEN FREE SAUSAGE ROLLS:\n\nIngredients:\n\n 2 large chicken breasts, 3 rashers streaky bacon, thinly sliced, 4 sundried tomatoes - chopped, handful basil leaves \u2013 chopped,  gluten free puff pastry, gluten free flour for dusting, 1 egg yolk, sesame seeds\n\nMethod:\n\n1. Whizz the chicken and garlic in a processor until the chicken is minced. Tip in the bacon, sundried tomatoes and basil. Pulse for 5 secs to just mix through. Season well.\n\n2. Roll the pastry sheet on a lightly floured surface and cut in half lengthways. Spread half the chicken mixture along the middle of one of the pastry strips, then roll up the pastry, pinching the ends together to seal. \n\n3. Heat oven to 220C/180C fan/gas6. Place the rolls on a large baking sheet. Brush with the egg, then sprinkle with seeds. Bake for 20 mins until golden. Cut into 2.5 m long pieces.\n\n_____\n\nRECIPE GLUTEN FREE EGG & CRESS CLUB SANDWICH:\n\nIngredients:\n\n 2 eggs, 2 tbsp mayonnaise, gluten free bread, butter, cress, 2-3 slices of tomato or lettuce leaf and a slice of ham or cheese\n\nMethod:\n\n1. Bring a pan of water to the boil and carefully lower in the eggs. Cook for 6 mins, then cool under running water until they can be peeled. Peel the eggs, then leave to cool completely.\n\n2. Mash or chop the eggs, then mix with mayonnaise and some seasoning if you like. Toast the bread.\n\n3. Lay one slice of bread on a board. Butter it, then spread on three quarters of the egg and scatter over the cress. Add another slice of toast and gently spread on the remaining mayo. Add the tomato or lettuce and ham or cheese (or whichever combination you prefer).  Top with the final piece of toast. Cut the crusts off if you like, then gently cut the sandwich into four quarters, being careful not to squash out the egg.\n\n_____\n\nCONNECT WITH ME:\n\nINSTAGRAM: https://www.instagram.com/kirsten_wick/\nPINTEREST: https://uk.pinterest.com/kirsten_wick/\nFACEBOOK: https://www.facebook.com/adventuresof...\nTWITTER: https://twitter.com/Kirsten_Wick",

Cut into 2.5 m long pieces.\n\n_____\n\nRECIPE GLUTEN FREE EGG & CRESS CLUB SANDWICH:\n\nIngredients:\n\n 2 eggs, 2 tbsp mayonnaise, gluten free bread, butter, cress, 2-3 slices of tomato or lettuce leaf and a slice of ham or cheese\n\nMethod:\n\n1. Bring a pan of water to the boil and carefully lower in the eggs. Cook for 6 mins, then cool under running water until they can be peeled. Peel the eggs, then leave to cool completely.\n\n2. Mash or chop the eggs, then mix with mayonnaise and some seasoning if you like. Toast the bread.\n\n3. Lay one slice of bread on a board. Butter it, then spread on three quarters of the egg and scatter over the cress. Add another slice of toast and gently spread on the remaining mayo. Add the tomato or lettuce and ham or cheese (or whichever combination you prefer).  Top with the final piece of toast. Cut the crusts off if you like, then gently cut the sandwich into four quarters, being careful not to squash out the egg.\n\n_____\n\nCONNECT WITH ME:\n\nINSTAGRAM: https://www.instagram.com/kirsten_wick/\nPINTEREST: https://uk.pinterest.com/kirsten_wick/\nFACEBOOK: https://www.facebook.com/adventuresof...\nTWITTER: https://twitter.com/Kirsten_Wick"

I actually made a very big mistake and because of that it made us realise that Joerg and I didn't listen to what our gut feeling was telling us from the very beginning. We usually listen to our hearts and seem to have forgotten that for one second so we start from scratch again. It's fine, you learn from you mistakes. A home renovation is a huge undertaking and you learn a lot along the way.

Over the next millennium kings and queens would invest lavish amounts in its development. \n\nAs a result, today it is one of the most magnificent sites in the British Isles. In this video, curator Kate Heard provides Dan Snow with an exclusive tour of the castle's beautiful state rooms and interior.\n\n#windsorcastle #historyhit #dansnow \n\nSign up to History Hit TV now and get 7 days free: http://access.historyhit.com/checkout\n\nFor more history content, subscribe to our History Hit newsletters: https://www.historyhit.com/sign-up-to...",

Over the next millennium kings and queens would invest lavish amounts in its development. \n\nAs a result, today it is one of the most magnificent sites in the British Isles. In this video, curator Kate Heard provides Dan Snow with an exclusive tour of the castle's beautiful state rooms and interior.\n\n#windsorcastle #historyhit #dansnow \n\nSign up to History Hit TV now and get 7 days free: http://access.historyhit.com/checkout\n\nFor more history content, subscribe to our History Hit newsletters: https://www.historyhit.com/sign-up-to..."

At the time, this area was a floodplain surrounded by thick woods. But this muddy valley would eventually become one of the greatest cities in the world. \n\nDiscover the past on History Hit with ad-free exclusive podcasts and documentaries released weekly presented by world renowned historians Dan Snow, Suzannah Lipscomb, Lucy Worsely, Mary Beard and more.

We explore archaeological finds that offer glimpses into daily life, from deciphered wax tablets revealing trade dealings to artifacts like spearheads, arrowheads, and fragments of armor. London's Roman history traces back to around 50 AD, when a mercantile trading post was established on a gravel terrace above the river Thames. At the time, this area was a floodplain surrounded by thick woods. But this muddy valley would eventually become one of the greatest cities in the world. \n\nDiscover the past on History Hit with ad-free exclusive podcasts and documentaries released weekly presented by world renowned historians Dan Snow, Suzannah Lipscomb, Lucy Worsely, Mary Beard and more.
