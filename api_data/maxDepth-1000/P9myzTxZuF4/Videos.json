It can be anything from animated graphics to an automatically generated Facebook timeline. When most people get interested in web development, they start with good old HTML and CSS. From there, they move on to JavaScript, which makes sense, because, these three elements together form the backbone of web development. HTML is the structure of your page like the headers, the body text, any images you want to include. It basically defines the contents of a web page.\nCSS controls how that page looks (it\u2019s what you\u2019ll use to customize fonts, background colors, etc.). JavaScript is the third element. Once you\u2019ve created your structure (HTML) and your aesthetic vibe (CSS), JavaScript makes your site dynamic (automatically updateable).\n\n\u27a1\ufe0f About Post Graduate Program In Full Stack Web Development\nThis program will give you the foundation for building full-stack web apps using the Java programming language.

It can be anything from animated graphics to an automatically generated Facebook timeline. When most people get interested in web development, they start with good old HTML and CSS. From there, they move on to JavaScript, which makes sense, because, these three elements together form the backbone of web development. HTML is the structure of your page like the headers, the body text, any images you want to include. It basically defines the contents of a web page.\nCSS controls how that page looks (it\u2019s what you\u2019ll use to customize fonts, background colors, etc.). JavaScript is the third element. Once you\u2019ve created your structure (HTML) and your aesthetic vibe (CSS), JavaScript makes your site dynamic (automatically updateable).\n\n\u27a1\ufe0f About Post Graduate Program In Full Stack Web Development\nThis program will give you the foundation for building full-stack web apps using the Java programming language.

                    "description": "Practicing business analyst interview questions and answers are a key part of BA interview preparation. In addition to researching the industry and companies you will be interviewing with, being equipped with sample interview questions that are likely to be asked will be your biggest asset toward landing your next business analyst job. In this video, I\u2019ll be sharing my list of the 35 essential business analyst interview questions and answers. The example answers provided are from my experience as an experienced business analyst. However, the answers can be useful for individuals with no formal business analyst experience as well. You would just need to reframe the responses to convey what you \u201cwould do\u201d instead of what you have done in past. You can also pull from any similar experiences from the past that may also demonstrate some of the same skill sets. Also, be sure to incorporate the business analysis best practices that are provided in the examples. \n\nIn addition to the business analyst interview questions and answers, I will also provide the most common \u201ctypes\u201d of interview question formats and provide general tips on how to approach the questions when formulating your responses. \n\nNow, if you haven't already, be sure to check out my video on the 6 Business Analyst RESUME TIPS to get more interviews here: https://youtu.be/xWyy9Hz6UTg\n\nSUBSCRIBE for more high-value business analysis content: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC0MgfX0-FkINpUaKFUbGRnw\n\nFor IIBA CERTIFICATION TRAINING  check out our courses here: https://the-business-analysis-doctor-self-paced-learning.thinkific.com/collections\n\nFor Business Analysis TEMPLATES, check out our BA Templates and Elicitation Questions Package here: https://the-business-analysis-doctor-self-paced-learning.thinkific.com/courses/business-analysis-template-package\n\nFor more business analysis resources, check out our website here: https://thebadoc.com/\n\n#businessanalyst #interviewquestionsandanswers #businessanalystjobs #interviewquestions #businessanalysis #careerguidance #career #careerdevelopment #interviewtips #interview #interviewpreparation #tellmeaboutyourself #elevatorpitch",

                        "description": "Practicing business analyst interview questions and answers are a key part of BA interview preparation. In addition to researching the industry and companies you will be interviewing with, being equipped with sample interview questions that are likely to be asked will be your biggest asset toward landing your next business analyst job. In this video, I\u2019ll be sharing my list of the 35 essential business analyst interview questions and answers. The example answers provided are from my experience as an experienced business analyst. However, the answers can be useful for individuals with no formal business analyst experience as well. You would just need to reframe the responses to convey what you \u201cwould do\u201d instead of what you have done in past. You can also pull from any similar experiences from the past that may also demonstrate some of the same skill sets. Also, be sure to incorporate the business analysis best practices that are provided in the examples. \n\nIn addition to the business analyst interview questions and answers, I will also provide the most common \u201ctypes\u201d of interview question formats and provide general tips on how to approach the questions when formulating your responses. \n\nNow, if you haven't already, be sure to check out my video on the 6 Business Analyst RESUME TIPS to get more interviews here: https://youtu.be/xWyy9Hz6UTg\n\nSUBSCRIBE for more high-value business analysis content: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC0MgfX0-FkINpUaKFUbGRnw\n\nFor IIBA CERTIFICATION TRAINING  check out our courses here: https://the-business-analysis-doctor-self-paced-learning.thinkific.com/collections\n\nFor Business Analysis TEMPLATES, check out our BA Templates and Elicitation Questions Package here: https://the-business-analysis-doctor-self-paced-learning.thinkific.com/courses/business-analysis-template-package\n\nFor more business analysis resources, check out our website here: https://thebadoc.com/\n\n#businessanalyst #interviewquestionsandanswers #businessanalystjobs #interviewquestions #businessanalysis #careerguidance #career #careerdevelopment #interviewtips #interview #interviewpreparation #tellmeaboutyourself #elevatorpitch"

In this tutorial, I discuss process mapping using the BPMN 2.0 method including the main elements of the BPMN notation, BPMN rules, and best practices, as well as a case study for the BPMN example!. \n\nA process map (flowchart) is a tool that graphically shows the inputs, actions, and outputs of a business process or workflow in a visually simple map of the process. The purpose of process mapping is to help teams understand the workflow during process analysis. Business Process Model and Notation is a process modeling notation created to standardize the graphical representation of business procedures, transactions, and business collaborations. It is becoming the standard notation for process management.\n\nSUBSCRIBE for more business analysis and project management tips: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC0MgfX0-FkINpUaKFUbGRnw/?sub_confirmation=1\n\nA business process map describes the sequential workflow of an organization or team. Business analysts use BPMN:\n - To describe the context of the solution or part of the solution,\n - To  describe what actually happens, or is desired to happen, during a process,\n - To  provide an understandable description of a sequence of activities to an observer,\n - To  provide a visual to accompany a text description, and\n - To provide a basis for process analysis.\n\nFor BA Certification training and resources, check out our courses here: https://the-business-analysis-doctor-self-paced-learning.thinkific.com/collections\n\nFor Business Analysis TEMPLATES, check out our BA Templates and Elicitation Questions Package here: https://the-business-analysis-doctor-self-paced-learning.thinkific.com/courses/business-analysis-template-package \n\nFor more business analysis resources, check out our website here: https://thebadoc.com\n\n#bpmn #processmapping #flowchart #businessanalysis #businessanalyst #iiba #babok #businessprocessmodeling\n\n\n\n\n\nNot Process Mapping Tutorial, but How to Create Flowchart in Powerpoint | Step-by-Step Tutorial, and How to Make a Flowchart in Word | Create a Flowchart with SmartArt, with How to Create Stunning Flowcharts in Microsoft Word, and Basics of Mapping a Process.

                        "description": "BPMN, formally Business Process Model and Notation is one of the most widely used methods for business process mapping and flowcharting. In this tutorial, I discuss process mapping using the BPMN 2.0 method including the main elements of the BPMN notation, BPMN rules, and best practices, as well as a case study for the BPMN example!. \n\nA process map (flowchart) is a tool that graphically shows the inputs, actions, and outputs of a business process or workflow in a visually simple map of the process. The purpose of process mapping is to help teams understand the workflow during process analysis. Business Process Model and Notation is a process modeling notation created to standardize the graphical representation of business procedures, transactions, and business collaborations. It is becoming the standard notation for process management.\n\nSUBSCRIBE for more business analysis and project management tips: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC0MgfX0-FkINpUaKFUbGRnw/?sub_confirmation=1\n\nA business process map describes the sequential workflow of an organization or team. Business analysts use BPMN:\n - To describe the context of the solution or part of the solution,\n - To  describe what actually happens, or is desired to happen, during a process,\n - To  provide an understandable description of a sequence of activities to an observer,\n - To  provide a visual to accompany a text description, and\n - To provide a basis for process analysis.\n\nFor BA Certification training and resources, check out our courses here: https://the-business-analysis-doctor-self-paced-learning.thinkific.com/collections\n\nFor Business Analysis TEMPLATES, check out our BA Templates and Elicitation Questions Package here: https://the-business-analysis-doctor-self-paced-learning.thinkific.com/courses/business-analysis-template-package \n\nFor more business analysis resources, check out our website here: https://thebadoc.com\n\n#bpmn #processmapping #flowchart #businessanalysis #businessanalyst #iiba #babok #businessprocessmodeling\n\n\n\n\n\nNot Process Mapping Tutorial, but How to Create Flowchart in Powerpoint | Step-by-Step Tutorial, and How to Make a Flowchart in Word | Create a Flowchart with SmartArt, with How to Create Stunning Flowcharts in Microsoft Word, and Basics of Mapping a Process.

Need a Use Case Description Example??? Well... you got it! This is a widely used approach to documenting functional requirements, which is why the use case description also makes the list of BABOKs 50 BA techniques. This requirements documentation technique is often paired with its visual counterpart known as the use case diagram. If you want to know the best practices for use case descriptions, check out this video!

                        "description": "A use case description AKA use case specification provides a way to verify that your functional requirements will cover all the bases and take all the possible scenarios into consideration. Need a Use Case Description Example??? Well... you got it! This is a widely used approach to documenting functional requirements, which is why the use case description also makes the list of BABOKs 50 BA techniques. This requirements documentation technique is often paired with its visual counterpart known as the use case diagram. If you want to know the best practices for use case descriptions, check out this video! I'll be presenting an example as well as the main components of the specification including actors (primary and secondary), basic flow, alternate flow, exception flow, scenarios, pre-conditions, post-conditions, and triggers.\n\nSUBSCRIBE for more high-value business analysis content: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC0MgfX0-FkINpUaKFUbGRnw\n\nLearn about Use Case DIAGRAMS here: \nhttps://youtu.be/8V3r5STTmbA\n\nWant to learn about Use Case Diagrams?

In this video, we'll look at how to create a use case diagram for business analysts. \nWe'll also look at the key components of the model including actors, scenarios, system boundaries, extend and include relationships, as well as generalizations. A use case is a functionality in a system that will allow the user to achieve a goal.

Check out what our successful students are saying about their experience:\nhttps://academy.notjust.dev\n\nIf you are a beginner that wants to learn javascript and react native, or and advanced javascript developer that wants to get into mobile development using react native then this Livestream is for you. This is a perfect opportunity to follow along and build this application together with us, and add it to your portfolio as it will help you land your next job. If you finish the app, tag me on social media and I will give you feedback.\n\nWe will start building the Whatsapp clone from scratch, starting from setting up a React Native project using Expo and finishing with connecting the application with a GraphQL backend using AWS Amplify. We will walk through designing the UI layout of the app, structuring everything in components, and putting everything together. We will also implement navigation between screens, header bars, and tab bars for the Whatsapp menu. \n\nFor the backend, we will be using AWS Amplify, which is an amazing combination of tools and services from AWS, that helps us build mobile and web applications faster. It offers pre-made authentication components and flows, database, API (REST and GraphQL), storage, and much more. We will be using Graphql subscriptions for the realtime chat functionalities\n\nDoing the Whatsapp clone yourself is a great opportunity to practice React Native, modern Javascript, Typescript, AWS Amplify. We are always trying to use the latest technologies and best practices, so that's another opportunity to learn something new, being it functional components, hooks, state, navigations or AWS and Amplify.\n\n\ud83d\udcac Join the notJust Development gang and let's build together:\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/VadimNotJustDev\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/VadimNotJustDev\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/notjustdev\nLinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/in/vadimsavin\nDiscord: https://discord.gg/VpURUN2\n\nTimecodes\n0:00 Intro\n9:47 Initialize the React Native project\n15:22 Project structure\n16:35 React Navigation\n50:57 Chat List Item Component\n1:31:05 Chat Rooms List (FlatList)\n1:48:34 Chat Screen\n2:51:17 Chat Input Component\n3:23:16 Floating Button (New Chat Room)\n3:45:52 Demo\n\n#VadimSavin #notjustdev #whatsapp",

Check out what our successful students are saying about their experience:\nhttps://academy.notjust.dev\n\nIf you are a beginner that wants to learn javascript and react native, or and advanced javascript developer that wants to get into mobile development using react native then this Livestream is for you. This is a perfect opportunity to follow along and build this application together with us, and add it to your portfolio as it will help you land your next job. If you finish the app, tag me on social media and I will give you feedback.\n\nWe will start building the Whatsapp clone from scratch, starting from setting up a React Native project using Expo and finishing with connecting the application with a GraphQL backend using AWS Amplify. We will walk through designing the UI layout of the app, structuring everything in components, and putting everything together. We will also implement navigation between screens, header bars, and tab bars for the Whatsapp menu. \n\nFor the backend, we will be using AWS Amplify, which is an amazing combination of tools and services from AWS, that helps us build mobile and web applications faster. It offers pre-made authentication components and flows, database, API (REST and GraphQL), storage, and much more. We will be using Graphql subscriptions for the realtime chat functionalities\n\nDoing the Whatsapp clone yourself is a great opportunity to practice React Native, modern Javascript, Typescript, AWS Amplify. We are always trying to use the latest technologies and best practices, so that's another opportunity to learn something new, being it functional components, hooks, state, navigations or AWS and Amplify.\n\n\ud83d\udcac Join the notJust Development gang and let's build together:\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/VadimNotJustDev\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/VadimNotJustDev\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/notjustdev\nLinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/in/vadimsavin\nDiscord: https://discord.gg/VpURUN2\n\nTimecodes\n0:00 Intro\n9:47 Initialize the React Native project\n15:22 Project structure\n16:35 React Navigation\n50:57 Chat List Item Component\n1:31:05 Chat Rooms List (FlatList)\n1:48:34 Chat Screen\n2:51:17 Chat Input Component\n3:23:16 Floating Button (New Chat Room)\n3:45:52 Demo\n\n#VadimSavin #notjustdev #whatsapp"

                    "description": "In this episode, my guest is Robert Greene, multiple New York Times bestselling author and expert on human psychology and behavior both at the individual and group levels and in the context of relationships, careers, and society. We discuss how to find, pursue and achieve one\u2019s unique life purpose, and how to best learn from good and hard experiences along that journey. We discuss power dynamics in relationships, the different types of human communication and the interplay between seduction and vulnerability. We discuss how to find the right romantic partner, improve healthy self-awareness, the link between anxiety and creativity, and pick ideal mentors and role models. Robert also discusses his recent stroke and what he has learned from his near-death experience about motivation, urgency and appreciation for life. Listeners of all ages will benefit from Robert\u2019s insights on navigating the process of building a deeply purposeful life and enhancing one\u2019s relationship with the self, others and society. \n\nThank you to our sponsors\nAG1: https://drinkag1.com/huberman\nROKA: https://roka.com/huberman\nHelix Sleep: https://helixsleep.com/huberman \nWaking Up: https://wakingup.com/huberman \nInsideTracker: https://insidetracker.com/huberman\nMomentous: https://www.livemomentous.com/huberman\n\nHuberman Lab Social & Website\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/hubermanlab \nThreads: https://www.threads.net/@hubermanlab\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/hubermanlab \nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/hubermanlab \nTikTok: https://www.tiktok.com/@hubermanlab \nLinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/in/andrew-huberman\nWebsite: https://www.hubermanlab.com \nNewsletter: https://www.hubermanlab.com/newsletter\n\nRobert Greene\nWebsite: https://powerseductionandwar.com \nBooks: https://powerseductionandwar.com/books\nBlog: https://powerseductionandwar.com/blog \nFacebook: https://Facebook.com/48LawsofPowerbook\nX: https://twitter.com/RobertGreene \nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/robertgreeneofficial \nTikTok: https://www.tiktok.com/@robertgreene \nYouTube: https://www.youtube.com/@RobertGreeneOfficial\n\nJournal Articles\nDistinct hypothalamic control of same- and opposite-sex mounting behaviour in mice: https://go.nature.com/46CqgWA\n\nBooks\n\"Mastery\": https://amzn.to/3QYMXhG\n\"Frames of Mind: The Theory of Multiple Intelligences\": https://amzn.to/4a7wuR5\n\"Bone Games: Extreme Sports, Shamanism, Zen, and the Search for Transcendence\": https://amzn.to/3TbspW2\n\nOther Resources\n\"How To Find Your Perfect Partner\": https://youtu.be/CQv3XGPoe2I?feature=shared\n\nTimestamps\n00:00:00 Robert Greene\n00:01:58 Sponsors: ROKA, Helix Sleep & Waking Up \n00:05:56 Mastery (The Book), Purpose\n00:08:26 Finding Purpose, Childhood, Learning & Emotional Engagement\n00:18:00 Early Interests, Delight & Discovery\n00:22:50 Love vs. Hate Experiences & Learning\n00:28:25 Self-Awareness, Frustration, Excitation\n00:31:47 Sponsor: AG1\n00:33:18 Sublime Experiences, Real vs. False; Authenticity & Time\n00:43:57 Power & Relationships; Purpose & Mastery\n00:55:51 Seduction, Vulnerability, Childhood\n01:07:04 Sponsor: InsideTracker\n01:08:05 Power Dynamics & Romance; Equality, Love Sublime & Connection\n01:18:42 Vulnerability in Relationships, Creativity; Social Media, Justice\n01:29:45 Outrage, Control, \u201cArt of Ignore\u201d\n01:33:50 Masculinity & Femininity\n01:42:16 Picking Role Models; Purpose & Mentor Relationship\n01:51:07 \u201cAlive\u201d Thinking; Anxiety & Creativity \n01:58:55 Convergent Interests & Romantic Relationships\n02:07:19 Self-Awareness, Core Values & Romantic Relationships\n02:15:27 Non-Verbal Communication & Relationships\n02:24:58 Eyes, Voice, Intuition & Seduction\n02:28:38 Virtual World, Social Skills, Non-Verbal Communication\n02:32:19 Self-Awareness & Intelligence, Artificial Intelligence (AI), Nuance\n02:41:43 Human Brain, Plasticity\n02:45:18 Stroke & Near-Death Experiences, Self, Time\n02:55:49 Appreciation & Near-Death Experience, Urgency\n03:01:36 \u201cDeath Ground\u201d & Urgency\n03:09:13 Zero-Cost Support, Spotify & Apple Reviews, Sponsors, YouTube Feedback, Momentous, Social Media, Neural Network Newsletter\n\n#HubermanLab #RobertGreene\n\nTitle Card Photo Credit: Mike Blabac - https://www.blabacphoto.com\n\nDisclaimer: https://www.hubermanlab.com/disclaimer",

                        "description": "In this episode, my guest is Robert Greene, multiple New York Times bestselling author and expert on human psychology and behavior both at the individual and group levels and in the context of relationships, careers, and society. We discuss how to find, pursue and achieve one\u2019s unique life purpose, and how to best learn from good and hard experiences along that journey. We discuss power dynamics in relationships, the different types of human communication and the interplay between seduction and vulnerability. We discuss how to find the right romantic partner, improve healthy self-awareness, the link between anxiety and creativity, and pick ideal mentors and role models. Robert also discusses his recent stroke and what he has learned from his near-death experience about motivation, urgency and appreciation for life. Listeners of all ages will benefit from Robert\u2019s insights on navigating the process of building a deeply purposeful life and enhancing one\u2019s relationship with the self, others and society. \n\nThank you to our sponsors\nAG1: https://drinkag1.com/huberman\nROKA: https://roka.com/huberman\nHelix Sleep: https://helixsleep.com/huberman \nWaking Up: https://wakingup.com/huberman \nInsideTracker: https://insidetracker.com/huberman\nMomentous: https://www.livemomentous.com/huberman\n\nHuberman Lab Social & Website\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/hubermanlab \nThreads: https://www.threads.net/@hubermanlab\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/hubermanlab \nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/hubermanlab \nTikTok: https://www.tiktok.com/@hubermanlab \nLinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/in/andrew-huberman\nWebsite: https://www.hubermanlab.com \nNewsletter: https://www.hubermanlab.com/newsletter\n\nRobert Greene\nWebsite: https://powerseductionandwar.com \nBooks: https://powerseductionandwar.com/books\nBlog: https://powerseductionandwar.com/blog \nFacebook: https://Facebook.com/48LawsofPowerbook\nX: https://twitter.com/RobertGreene \nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/robertgreeneofficial \nTikTok: https://www.tiktok.com/@robertgreene \nYouTube: https://www.youtube.com/@RobertGreeneOfficial\n\nJournal Articles\nDistinct hypothalamic control of same- and opposite-sex mounting behaviour in mice: https://go.nature.com/46CqgWA\n\nBooks\n\"Mastery\": https://amzn.to/3QYMXhG\n\"Frames of Mind: The Theory of Multiple Intelligences\": https://amzn.to/4a7wuR5\n\"Bone Games: Extreme Sports, Shamanism, Zen, and the Search for Transcendence\": https://amzn.to/3TbspW2\n\nOther Resources\n\"How To Find Your Perfect Partner\": https://youtu.be/CQv3XGPoe2I?feature=shared\n\nTimestamps\n00:00:00 Robert Greene\n00:01:58 Sponsors: ROKA, Helix Sleep & Waking Up \n00:05:56 Mastery (The Book), Purpose\n00:08:26 Finding Purpose, Childhood, Learning & Emotional Engagement\n00:18:00 Early Interests, Delight & Discovery\n00:22:50 Love vs. Hate Experiences & Learning\n00:28:25 Self-Awareness, Frustration, Excitation\n00:31:47 Sponsor: AG1\n00:33:18 Sublime Experiences, Real vs. False; Authenticity & Time\n00:43:57 Power & Relationships; Purpose & Mastery\n00:55:51 Seduction, Vulnerability, Childhood\n01:07:04 Sponsor: InsideTracker\n01:08:05 Power Dynamics & Romance; Equality, Love Sublime & Connection\n01:18:42 Vulnerability in Relationships, Creativity; Social Media, Justice\n01:29:45 Outrage, Control, \u201cArt of Ignore\u201d\n01:33:50 Masculinity & Femininity\n01:42:16 Picking Role Models; Purpose & Mentor Relationship\n01:51:07 \u201cAlive\u201d Thinking; Anxiety & Creativity \n01:58:55 Convergent Interests & Romantic Relationships\n02:07:19 Self-Awareness, Core Values & Romantic Relationships\n02:15:27 Non-Verbal Communication & Relationships\n02:24:58 Eyes, Voice, Intuition & Seduction\n02:28:38 Virtual World, Social Skills, Non-Verbal Communication\n02:32:19 Self-Awareness & Intelligence, Artificial Intelligence (AI), Nuance\n02:41:43 Human Brain, Plasticity\n02:45:18 Stroke & Near-Death Experiences, Self, Time\n02:55:49 Appreciation & Near-Death Experience, Urgency\n03:01:36 \u201cDeath Ground\u201d & Urgency\n03:09:13 Zero-Cost Support, Spotify & Apple Reviews, Sponsors, YouTube Feedback, Momentous, Social Media, Neural Network Newsletter\n\n#HubermanLab #RobertGreene\n\nTitle Card Photo Credit: Mike Blabac - https://www.blabacphoto.com\n\nDisclaimer: https://www.hubermanlab.com/disclaimer"

He is also an avid public educator, having written five bestselling books, delivered several top-ranking TED Talks and is the host of two psychology podcasts. We discuss how to overcome procrastination, how to increase intrinsic motivation (even for dreaded tasks), identify blind spots and rethink our assumptions, and how we can build a persistent growth mindset. We also explain tools to improve creativity and discuss the surprising relationship between creativity and procrastination. We then explore how to effectively solicit useful feedback and grow from constructive criticism and how you can improve your level of focus and attention using science-supported methods. We also discuss mental tools to get out of negative thought spirals, how to nurture potential in yourself or others, and the dark side of perfectionism. The discussion delivers more than a dozen science-supported protocols that are readily applicable to anyone seeking to live a more productive, fulfilling, and creative life.\n\nFor the show notes, including referenced articles and additional resources, please visit https://www.hubermanlab.com/episode/dr-adam-grant-how-to-unlock-your-potential-motivation-unique-abilities\n\nThank you to our sponsors\nAG1: https://drinkag1.com/huberman\nEight Sleep: https://eightsleep.com/huberman \nLevels: https://levels.link/huberman\nWaking Up: https://www.wakingup.com/huberman\nInsideTracker: https://insidetracker.com/huberman\nMomentous: https://livemomentous.com/huberman \n\nHuberman Lab Social & Website\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/hubermanlab \nThreads: https://www.threads.net/@hubermanlab\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/hubermanlab \nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/hubermanlab \nTikTok: https://www.tiktok.com/@hubermanlab \nLinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/in/andrew-huberman\nWebsite: https://www.hubermanlab.com \nNewsletter: https://www.hubermanlab.com/newsletter\n\nDr. Adam Grant\nWebsite: https://adamgrant.net \nBooks: https://adamgrant.net/books\nPodcasts: https://adamgrant.net/podcasts\nAcademic profile: https://mgmt.wharton.upenn.edu/profile/grantad\nTED Talk: \u201cAre You a Giver or a Taker?\u201d: https://www.ted.com/talks/adam_grant_are_you_a_giver_or_a_taker \nTED Talk: \u201c The Surprising Habits of Original Thinkers\u201d: https://www.ted.com/talks/adam_grant_the_surprising_habits_of_original_thinkers \nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/adamgrant \nX: https://twitter.com/adammgrant \nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/AdamMGrant \nLinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/in/adammgrant \nThreads: https://www.threads.net/@adamgrant \n\nTimestamps\n00:00:00 Dr. Adam Grant\n00:01:37 Sponsors: Eight Sleep, Levels & Waking Up\n00:05:56 Procrastination & Emotion; Curiosity\n00:14:06 Creativity & Procrastination; Motivation\n00:20:48 Intrinsic Motivation & Curiosity\n00:27:59 Tool: Tasks & Sense of Purpose\n00:30:52 Sponsor: AG1\n00:32:34 Extrinsic Rewards, Choice; Social Media\n00:42:24 Tool: \u201cQuiet Time\u201d Protocol, Chronotypes\n00:49:20 Tool: Creativity: Mornings, Movement, Stillness\n00:57:05 Sponsor: InsideTracker\n00:58:14 Tools: Ideas & Filtering, Feedback & Opinions, Advice\n01:07:15 Tool: Constructive Criticism, \u201cSecond Score\u201d; Verbs\n01:14:40 Tool: Growth Mindsets, Scaffolding; Job Innovation\n01:21:50 Tools: Task Sequencing & Intrinsic Motivation; Tapering & Frame of Reference\n01:30:03 Tools: Momentum, Confidence & Domains; Negative Thought Spirals\n01:36:16 Tool: Phone & \u201cTo Don\u2019t\u201d List; Writing Ideas\n01:39:54 Tool: Bias Blindspot, Reflected Best-Self Portrait\n01:45:36 Helping Others, Synthesizing Information\n01:50:24 Modes of Thinking, Blind Spots & Assumptions\n01:56:10 Thinking Like a Scientist: Hypothesis-Testing & Discourse, Social Media\n02:05:15 Tool: Authenticity, Sincerity & Etiquette, \u201cSnapshot\u201d & Online Presence\n02:12:49 Realizing Potential: Motivation, Opportunity & Process\n02:21:53 Skills to Realize Potential, Perfectionism\n02:27:52 Tool: Early Success & Performance Cycle, \u201cFailure Budget\u201d\n02:31:56 Future Projects, Complex Issues & Challenging Ideas\n02:40:10 Artistic Hobbies, Magicians\n02:45:55 Science Communication, Interest & Self-Relevance\n02:52:16 Languishing, Descriptive Language & Emotions\n03:00:09 Tool: Nurture Potential in Children, \u201cCoach Effect\u201d\n03:10:16 Zero-Cost Support, Spotify & Apple Reviews, Sponsors, YouTube Feedback, Momentous, Social Media, Neural Network Newsletter\n\n#HubermanLab #AdamGrant #Science\n\nTitle Card Photo Credit: Mike Blabac - https://www.blabacphoto.com\n\nDisclaimer: https://www.hubermanlab.com/disclaimer",

The discussion delivers more than a dozen science-supported protocols that are readily applicable to anyone seeking to live a more productive, fulfilling, and creative life.\n\nFor the show notes, including referenced articles and additional resources, please visit https://www.hubermanlab.com/episode/dr-adam-grant-how-to-unlock-your-potential-motivation-unique-abilities\n\nThank you to our sponsors\nAG1: https://drinkag1.com/huberman\nEight Sleep: https://eightsleep.com/huberman \nLevels: https://levels.link/huberman\nWaking Up: https://www.wakingup.com/huberman\nInsideTracker: https://insidetracker.com/huberman\nMomentous: https://livemomentous.com/huberman \n\nHuberman Lab Social & Website\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/hubermanlab \nThreads: https://www.threads.net/@hubermanlab\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/hubermanlab \nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/hubermanlab \nTikTok: https://www.tiktok.com/@hubermanlab \nLinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/in/andrew-huberman\nWebsite: https://www.hubermanlab.com \nNewsletter: https://www.hubermanlab.com/newsletter\n\nDr. Adam Grant\nWebsite: https://adamgrant.net \nBooks: https://adamgrant.net/books\nPodcasts: https://adamgrant.net/podcasts\nAcademic profile: https://mgmt.wharton.upenn.edu/profile/grantad\nTED Talk: \u201cAre You a Giver or a Taker?\u201d: https://www.ted.com/talks/adam_grant_are_you_a_giver_or_a_taker \nTED Talk: \u201c The Surprising Habits of Original Thinkers\u201d: https://www.ted.com/talks/adam_grant_the_surprising_habits_of_original_thinkers \nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/adamgrant \nX: https://twitter.com/adammgrant \nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/AdamMGrant \nLinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/in/adammgrant \nThreads: https://www.threads.net/@adamgrant \n\nTimestamps\n00:00:00 Dr. Adam Grant\n00:01:37 Sponsors: Eight Sleep, Levels & Waking Up\n00:05:56 Procrastination & Emotion; Curiosity\n00:14:06 Creativity & Procrastination; Motivation\n00:20:48 Intrinsic Motivation & Curiosity\n00:27:59 Tool: Tasks & Sense of Purpose\n00:30:52 Sponsor: AG1\n00:32:34 Extrinsic Rewards, Choice; Social Media\n00:42:24 Tool: \u201cQuiet Time\u201d Protocol, Chronotypes\n00:49:20 Tool: Creativity: Mornings, Movement, Stillness\n00:57:05 Sponsor: InsideTracker\n00:58:14 Tools: Ideas & Filtering, Feedback & Opinions, Advice\n01:07:15 Tool: Constructive Criticism, \u201cSecond Score\u201d; Verbs\n01:14:40 Tool: Growth Mindsets, Scaffolding; Job Innovation\n01:21:50 Tools: Task Sequencing & Intrinsic Motivation; Tapering & Frame of Reference\n01:30:03 Tools: Momentum, Confidence & Domains; Negative Thought Spirals\n01:36:16 Tool: Phone & \u201cTo Don\u2019t\u201d List; Writing Ideas\n01:39:54 Tool: Bias Blindspot, Reflected Best-Self Portrait\n01:45:36 Helping Others, Synthesizing Information\n01:50:24 Modes of Thinking, Blind Spots & Assumptions\n01:56:10 Thinking Like a Scientist: Hypothesis-Testing & Discourse, Social Media\n02:05:15 Tool: Authenticity, Sincerity & Etiquette, \u201cSnapshot\u201d & Online Presence\n02:12:49 Realizing Potential: Motivation, Opportunity & Process\n02:21:53 Skills to Realize Potential, Perfectionism\n02:27:52 Tool: Early Success & Performance Cycle, \u201cFailure Budget\u201d\n02:31:56 Future Projects, Complex Issues & Challenging Ideas\n02:40:10 Artistic Hobbies, Magicians\n02:45:55 Science Communication, Interest & Self-Relevance\n02:52:16 Languishing, Descriptive Language & Emotions\n03:00:09 Tool: Nurture Potential in Children, \u201cCoach Effect\u201d\n03:10:16 Zero-Cost Support, Spotify & Apple Reviews, Sponsors, YouTube Feedback, Momentous, Social Media, Neural Network Newsletter\n\n#HubermanLab #AdamGrant #Science\n\nTitle Card Photo Credit: Mike Blabac - https://www.blabacphoto.com\n\nDisclaimer: https://www.hubermanlab.com/disclaimer"

She is the creator and host of the podcast, A Slight Change of Plans. We discuss how our identities develop and change, how our beliefs and internal narratives shape our perception of self, and how to use structured introspection about our values to determine our goals. We discuss how to cope and grow through uncertain situations, especially those that force us to reexamine our roles and identity. Dr. Shankar shares her experience of redefining her identity after an early career-ending setback. She also explains numerous science-based strategies to effectively define goals, structure our goal pursuits and maintain consistent motivation. This episode provides a science-supported toolkit and roadmap to assess your identity and goals and positively transform in the face of change.\n\n#HubermanLab #Science\n\nThank you to our sponsors\nAG1: https://drinkag1.com/huberman \nMaui Nui Venison: https://mauinuivenison.com/huberman \nEight Sleep: https://eightsleep.com/huberman \nInsideTracker: https://insidetracker.com/huberman \n\nSupplements from Momentous\nhttps://www.livemomentous.com/huberman\n\nHuberman Lab Social & Website\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/hubermanlab \nThreads: https://www.threads.net/@hubermanlab\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/hubermanlab \nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/hubermanlab \nTikTok: https://www.tiktok.com/@hubermanlab \nLinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/in/andrew-huberman\nWebsite: https://hubermanlab.com \nNewsletter: https://hubermanlab.com/neural-network\n\nDr. Maya Shankar\nWebsite: https://mayashankar.com\nA Slight Change of Plans: https://apple.co/slightchangeofplans\nTED Talk: https://youtu.be/Tt0arZN6EBM\nYouTube: https://www.youtube.com/@drmayashankar\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/drmayashankar\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/slightchangepod \nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/drmayashankar\nPublications: https://mayashankar.com/publications \n\nArticles\nOn the dimensionality of odor space: https://bit.ly/475304P\nComputations of uncertainty mediate acute stress responses in humans: https://go.nature.com/43y8IJG\nThe End of History Illusion: https://bit.ly/3KcPkeh\nAchievement Goals and the Hierarchical Model of Achievement Motivation: https://bit.ly/3rFmrkz\nThey Saw a Game: A Case Study: https://bit.ly/44YMphc\nThe Fresh Start Effect: Temporal Landmarks Motivate Aspirational Behavior: https://bit.ly/46Tszps\nHolding the Hunger Games Hostage at the Gym: An Evaluation of Temptation Bundling: https://bit.ly/44Zax3d\n\nBooks\nChatter: The Voice in Our Head, Why It Matters, and How to Harness It: https://amzn.to/3pZl4g6\nAwe: The New Science of Everyday Wonder and How It Can Transform Your Life: https://amzn.to/3QaS0Nw\nGet It Done: Surprising Lessons from the Science of Motivation: https://amzn.to/3pRxtTu\nThe War for Kindness: Building Empathy in a Fractured World: https://amzn.to/3Kailra\nThinking, Fast and Slow: https://amzn.to/3q3u1VN\n\nOther Resources\nIdentity Paralysis: https://bit.ly/3rFjEYE \nReginald Dwayne Betts: https://nyti.ms/3O52uLx \nRick Rubin: How to Access Your Creativity (Huberman Lab episode): https://bit.ly/44Bjb8B  \nDr. Arie Kruglanski & Cognitive Closure: https://bit.ly/3KanqQ4 \nDr. Ethan Kross & Venting: https://bit.ly/3Qbrt2E \nSlight Change of Plans - Daryl Davis episode: https://bit.ly/3Y6cCbA \nLet\u2019s See a Game: https://bit.ly/44Oca3U \nPeak-end Rule: https://bit.ly/3rIyo9i \n\nTimestamps\n00:00:00 Dr. Maya Shankar\n00:02:37 Sponsors: Maui Nui Venison & Eight Sleep\n00:05:15 Identity Foreclosure, Identity Paralysis, Throughlines\n00:12:10 Identity & Adolescence; \u201cEssence\u201d & Shame\n00:16:58 Delight & Awe\n00:23:00 Delight & Possibilities for Self\n00:29:28 Playing Violin, Childhood\n00:34:54 Sponsor: AG1\n00:35:58 Intrinsic Motivation; Juilliard & Courage\n00:45:43 Competitive Environments; Curiosity & Growth\n00:53:46 Re-Creating of Self\n01:00:51 Pop-Science, Science Accessibility\n01:05:25 Sponsor: InsideTracker\n01:06:32 Passions & Curiosity\n01:13:20 Change, Cognitive Closure, End-of-History Illusion\n01:22:29 Self-Awareness & Critical Feedback\n01:30:48 Tools: Flexible Mindset; Reframing & Venting; Gratitude\n01:40:13 Tool: Framing Goals\n01:47:13 Tool: Agency in Goal Pursuit\n01:52:25 Tool: Like-Minded People & Goal Pursuit; Challenging Beliefs\n02:01:27 Cultivating Open-Mindedness & Empathy\n02:08:15 Building Self Narratives: Empathy, Burnout\n02:13:56 Tools: Goal Setting\n02:19:54 Tool: \u201cMiddle Problem\u201d, Maintaining Motivation\n02:24:55 Tool: Aversion & Memory, Peak-End Rule\n02:31:41 Zero-Cost Support, YouTube Feedback, Spotify & Apple Reviews, Sponsors, Momentous, Neural Network Newsletter, Social Media\n\nTitle Card Photo Credit: Mike Blabac - https://www.blabacphoto.com\n\nDisclaimer: https://hubermanlab.com/disclaimer",
