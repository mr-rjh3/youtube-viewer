Using rare and previously unseen archive and interviews with Edward and Wallis Simpson, this is the real story of the man who gave up the throne to pursue his obsession with a twice-divorced American.\n\nThe strength of Edward\u2019s feelings for his lover sparked the abdication crisis of 1936. Instead of a coronation in 1937, Edward married Wallis, and as the Duke and Duchess of Windsor the couple embarked into a life of exile and roleless celebrity.  \n\n\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\n\nSubscribe Free Documentary - History Channel for free: https://bit.ly/2FjRPgV\n\nFacebook: https://bit.ly/2QfRxbG\nTwitter: https://bit.ly/2QlwRiI\n\n\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\n#FreeDocumentary #Documentary #EdwardVIII\n\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\n\nFree Documentary - History is dedicated to bringing high-class documentaries to you on YouTube for free.

Using rare and previously unseen archive and interviews with Edward and Wallis Simpson, this is the real story of the man who gave up the throne to pursue his obsession with a twice-divorced American.\n\nThe strength of Edward\u2019s feelings for his lover sparked the abdication crisis of 1936. Instead of a coronation in 1937, Edward married Wallis, and as the Duke and Duchess of Windsor the couple embarked into a life of exile and roleless celebrity.  \n\n\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\n\nSubscribe Free Documentary - History Channel for free: https://bit.ly/2FjRPgV\n\nFacebook: https://bit.ly/2QfRxbG\nTwitter: https://bit.ly/2QlwRiI\n\n\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\n#FreeDocumentary #Documentary #EdwardVIII\n\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\n\nFree Documentary - History is dedicated to bringing high-class documentaries to you on YouTube for free.

                    "description": "The Coronation in 1953 appeared to be a glittering triumph for the House of Windsor. But behind the scenes there was a three-cornered story of jealousy and rivalry at the highest level.\n\nOn one side Prince Philip was at odds with the Queen Mother over his desire to modernise the monarchy. On the other the old Queen was jealous of her daughter's sudden rise to power. The Coronation was a critical year for the young Queen Elizabeth. She was preparing to undergo the most ancient and important royal ritual, but the two people closest to her, the Queen Mother and Prince Philip had very different ideas about how it should be handled. Philip, the dashing but dangerously modern consort, was anxious that the Coronation should not be simply a stuffy replay of previous reigns. He wanted 'some features relevant to the world today'. But he was fiercely resisted by the Queen Mother and by Princess Mary, who referred to Philip as 'the Hun'.\n\nThe new Queen was caught in the middle. In Coronation Coup, we learn that Mountbatten, who had engineered the marriage between Philip and Elizabeth wanted the family name changed to Windsor-Mountbatten after her accession. Also, while the new Queen largely sided with her mother over arrangements for the Coronation, she backed Philip over perhaps the most important decision to televise the ceremony inside Westminster Abbey. In doing so she set a precedent for television to be given access to the most intimate rituals.\n\n It's like Netflix for history...

                    "description": "Henry VII may have ended the Wars of the Roses by taking the crown from Richard III on the battlefield at Bosworth, but he could never have held together the fragile peace England found in its wake without one woman - his wife and queen, Elizabeth of York. Elizabeth was a princess born to a new dynasty, destined to endure great tragedy and great joy, and to be the mother of yet another new dynasty, the Tudors. This video looks at Elizabeth's life and the obstacles she overcame to take her rightful place in England's history...\n\n***Apologies for my error about Elizabeth Woodville's son - it was her younger son, Richard Grey, who was executed by Richard III, not her elder son Thomas Grey, as I've incorrectly stated.
