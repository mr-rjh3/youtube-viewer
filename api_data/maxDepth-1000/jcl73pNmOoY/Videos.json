If the atom has more than one electron, each one requires more energy than the previous one.

I created an app to find out, and in this video I used my app to share what I learned. As it turns out, the results are quite musical.\n\nImportant note: This audio includes some very low frequencies, which you might not hear through typical cell phone or laptop speakers.

                    "description": "What weighs about three pounds, uses electrical impulses, and stores unlimited amounts of information or data? Your brain! In this video for kids, you will learn a lot more about this fascinating organ of the human body that is almost like a computer. As the main part of the central nervous system, the brain has lot of important functions. This video will teach you about six parts of the brain and what they do.\n\nThe cerebrum is the biggest part of the brain. It makes up about 85% of the brain's weight. It allows us to control voluntary muscles so they can do things like kick a ball, walk down the street, or jump in the air. It also allows us to think. We depend on this important part of the brain when it comes to remembering things as well. \n\nThe brain stem, which connects the brain to the spinal cord, is responsible for things like breathing, digesting food, and circulating blood throughout the body. It controls involuntary muscles, which are the muscles that work on their own. For instance, the brain stem tells the heart to pump blood or the stomach muscles to break food down. It is below the cerebrum and in front of the cerebellum. Speaking of the cerebellum, this part of the brain controls balance, movement, and coordination. Without it, you would have trouble moving around.\n\nThe other three parts are the pituitary gland, the hypothalamus, and the amygdala. The pituitary gland controls how the body grows by producing and releasing hormones. Without it, you would never grow as you age. The hypothalamus controls the temperature of your body. When it's hot, it tells your body to sweat, and it tells your body to shiver when it's cold. And the amygdala is like the control center for feelings and is responsible for your emotions.\n\nWe hope you and your student(s) enjoyed learning about how the brain works!

You will discover the properties and traits that make these rocks unique. And maybe you will find that being a geologist, a scientist that studies rocks, would totally rock!\n\nYour kids will learn interesting facts about sedimentary rocks, metamorphic rocks, and igneous rocks. For instance, did you know that fossils are really only found in sedimentary rocks? You wouldn't find a dinosaur bone in a slab of marble. Speaking of marble, marble is a type of metamorphic rock. Metamorphic rocks form with really high pressure and heat beneath the earth's surface.\n\nIgneous rocks actually divide further into two categories. There are intrusive (or plutonic) igneous rocks and extrusive igneous rocks. Intrusive rocks form when magma cools slowly inside the earth. An example of an intrusive igneous rock is granite. Extrusive igneous rocks form when lava cools really quickly. If lava cools fast enough, it creates obsidian. \n\nWe hope you and your student(s) enjoyed learning about rocks and geology!

This makes them easier to be studied. Scientists classify animals, plants and insects based on things they have in common. Just like kids would do with their toys!\n\nTaxonomy means to classify living things. Scientists and biologists use a taxonomy chart to classify all the organisms on Earth. This chart includes the following groups: Domain, Kingdom, Phylum, Class, Order, Family, Genus and Species.  Throughout the video we will learn about the different taxonomies, how animals are classified and spend a little more time on vertebrates and invertebrates.  By the end you kid will have a more solid understanding of what makes animals different and may be able to classify them into their proper taxonomies.\n\nWould you like even more Animal Classification Learning resources?

                    "description": "What is your favorite season in the year? The Four Seasons for Kids explores why we have these distinct periods throughout the year. You will learn a lot about spring, summer, fall, and winter. Did you know that the seasons depend on the rotation of the earth around the sun? Believe it or not, your location plays a part in the weather you experience outside.\n\nAs the earth rotates around the sun, different parts of the planet face the sun. For half the year, the Northern Hemisphere is leaning toward the sun, making the months warmer. During the other half, the Souther Hemisphere leans toward the sun. That means that when it's summer in the Northern Hemisphere, it's winter in the Southern Hemisphere! If you live in the United State and have a friend who lives in Australia, your winter is their summer and vice versa.\n\nDuring the spring, flowers and plants bloom or blossom. In most parts of the United States, this season occurs during March, April, and May. Summer is next and occurs during June, July, and August. The temperatures warm up even more, sometimes getting very hot! In the fall, the weather starts to cool down, and the leaves of many trees change colors. \n\nA lot of people refer to fall as autumn. During autumn, animals start to gather food to prepare for the winter months. And this is period is also when farmers harvest their crops. Fall happens from September to November, which leaves December through February for winter! Winter brings the coldest weather, but there are lots of fun activities to do outside during the winter, such as skiing and ice skating.\n\nNot all places experience the four seasons. Some places, such as the North and South Poles, always face away from the sun, making them cold year around. Similarly, places closest to the Equator are always facing the sun, making them warm year around. You might live somewhere that doesn't change very much or seem to have distinct weather changes from season to season. But you probably still feel a little cooler in winter and warmer in summer, even if the changes aren't very drastic.\n\nWe hope you and your student(s) enjoyed learning about these four seasons and what makes each one unique!

                        "description": "What is your favorite season in the year? The Four Seasons for Kids explores why we have these distinct periods throughout the year. You will learn a lot about spring, summer, fall, and winter. Did you know that the seasons depend on the rotation of the earth around the sun? Believe it or not, your location plays a part in the weather you experience outside.\n\nAs the earth rotates around the sun, different parts of the planet face the sun. For half the year, the Northern Hemisphere is leaning toward the sun, making the months warmer. During the other half, the Souther Hemisphere leans toward the sun. That means that when it's summer in the Northern Hemisphere, it's winter in the Southern Hemisphere! If you live in the United State and have a friend who lives in Australia, your winter is their summer and vice versa.\n\nDuring the spring, flowers and plants bloom or blossom. In most parts of the United States, this season occurs during March, April, and May. Summer is next and occurs during June, July, and August. The temperatures warm up even more, sometimes getting very hot! In the fall, the weather starts to cool down, and the leaves of many trees change colors. \n\nA lot of people refer to fall as autumn. During autumn, animals start to gather food to prepare for the winter months. And this is period is also when farmers harvest their crops. Fall happens from September to November, which leaves December through February for winter! Winter brings the coldest weather, but there are lots of fun activities to do outside during the winter, such as skiing and ice skating.\n\nNot all places experience the four seasons. Some places, such as the North and South Poles, always face away from the sun, making them cold year around. Similarly, places closest to the Equator are always facing the sun, making them warm year around. You might live somewhere that doesn't change very much or seem to have distinct weather changes from season to season. But you probably still feel a little cooler in winter and warmer in summer, even if the changes aren't very drastic.\n\nWe hope you and your student(s) enjoyed learning about these four seasons and what makes each one unique!

                    "description": "Do you know what mountains, hills, plateaus, and plains have in common? This video teaches kids all about landforms, particularly these four. Your kids will learn all about the different types and how they form. They will discover many interesting facts. For instance, they will learn about the Himalayas and how they make up the tallest mountain range in the world. Mount Everest is the tallest peak of the Himalayas. It's as tall as 48,000 people standing on each others' shoulders!\n\nHills are similar to mountains. They aren't as tall, but they form in similar ways. In fact, some mountains, including the Himalayas, started out as hills! Did you know there are two types of plateaus? All plateaus are flat and elevated, and they have steep hills and big cliffs. However, not all plateaus are the same. Dissected plateaus are created from tectonic shifts from the ground up. The Colorado Plateau is one of these. Volcanic plateaus, however, are formed from many small volcanic eruptions that build up over time. Most of the central part of the North Island of New Zealand. You will also learn about plains and how they are unique compared to the other three landforms.\n\nWe hope you and your student(s) enjoyed learning about these four different landforms!

                        "description": "Do you know what mountains, hills, plateaus, and plains have in common? This video teaches kids all about landforms, particularly these four. Your kids will learn all about the different types and how they form. They will discover many interesting facts. For instance, they will learn about the Himalayas and how they make up the tallest mountain range in the world. Mount Everest is the tallest peak of the Himalayas. It's as tall as 48,000 people standing on each others' shoulders!\n\nHills are similar to mountains. They aren't as tall, but they form in similar ways. In fact, some mountains, including the Himalayas, started out as hills! Did you know there are two types of plateaus? All plateaus are flat and elevated, and they have steep hills and big cliffs. However, not all plateaus are the same. Dissected plateaus are created from tectonic shifts from the ground up. The Colorado Plateau is one of these. Volcanic plateaus, however, are formed from many small volcanic eruptions that build up over time. Most of the central part of the North Island of New Zealand. You will also learn about plains and how they are unique compared to the other three landforms.\n\nWe hope you and your student(s) enjoyed learning about these four different landforms!

                    "description": "Did you know that several million earthquakes happen every year? Earthquakes for Kids STEM is a great video to learn a little more about earthquakes. Most earthquakes are so small in magnitude that we can't feel them. The United States Geological Survey only records about 20 each year in the US.\n\nThe reason earthquakes happen in the first place has to do with the tectonic plates below the surface of the earth. Tectonic plates move around constantly. Those movements cause tension, which in turn causes huge faults or cracks in the rocks. The faults sometimes get stuck, and when they get unstuck, they cause an earthquake! Tectonic plates move in three ways: subduction, lateral sliding, and spreading.\n\nThe closer you are to an earthquake's epicenter, the more strongly you will feel it. This is because an earthquake loses its intensity as it travels away from the epicenter. Scientists measure the intensity of an earthquake using a seismograph, which detects and measures the vibrations of the earthquake. The magnitude of the earthquake is the number we assign to record its size. A magnitude of 5.5 if considered moderate. Above 8.0 means it's a major earthquake. And earthquakes with a magnitude of 2.5 or lower are usually not felt at all.\n\nWe hope you and your student(s) enjoyed learning about earthquakes!

                    "description": "Did you know that 70% of the earth is covered by water? Water is everywhere! You and your kids or students will learn all sorts of interesting things about water in this video.. Water is a major necessity to life. Without water, life on Earth wouldn't even exist! And that includes all life\u2014not just humankind. \n\nThis video describes what water is made of: hydrogen and oxygen. It also talks about how water can be found in the form of a solid, liquid, or gas. As a solid, it's called ice. That happens when water freezes. In fact, snowflakes are simply really, really small ice crystals, but they are still water! When water gets hot, it turns into a gas. This is called water vapor or steam. \n\nWater can be found almost anywhere. Most of it is in liquid form and is found in the oceans all over the world. But don't forget about polar ice caps and glaciers, lakes and rivers, and ground water from rain that has seeped into the earth. There are two types of water: salt water and fresh water. Most of the water on Earth is salt water. Humans can only drink fresh water, however, because drinking salt water would make us sick. This video explains that if you compared all the water on the earth to a gallon of water, only a teaspoon of it would equal the amount of fresh water on the earth!\n\nWe hope you and your student(s) enjoyed learning about water! If you want to learn more, head over to our website and download one of our many free lesson plans about water full of activities, worksheets, and more! \n\nhttps://learnbright.org/lessons/science/water-water-everywhere/\n\nWhat you will learn in this video:\n0:00 Introduction to water and what we use it for\n1:10 What is water?\n1:32 What is water made of?\n2:19 Water as a liquid, solid, and gas\n3:30 Where does water come from?\n4:18 Types of water\n5:17 Salt water versus fresh water\n6:00 The importance of fresh water and how to conserve it\n7:14 Review time\n8:12 What did you learn?\n\nThank you for watching and learning with us!

                        "description": "Did you know that 70% of the earth is covered by water? Water is everywhere! You and your kids or students will learn all sorts of interesting things about water in this video.. Water is a major necessity to life. Without water, life on Earth wouldn't even exist! And that includes all life\u2014not just humankind. \n\nThis video describes what water is made of: hydrogen and oxygen. It also talks about how water can be found in the form of a solid, liquid, or gas. As a solid, it's called ice. That happens when water freezes. In fact, snowflakes are simply really, really small ice crystals, but they are still water! When water gets hot, it turns into a gas. This is called water vapor or steam. \n\nWater can be found almost anywhere. Most of it is in liquid form and is found in the oceans all over the world. But don't forget about polar ice caps and glaciers, lakes and rivers, and ground water from rain that has seeped into the earth. There are two types of water: salt water and fresh water. Most of the water on Earth is salt water. Humans can only drink fresh water, however, because drinking salt water would make us sick. This video explains that if you compared all the water on the earth to a gallon of water, only a teaspoon of it would equal the amount of fresh water on the earth!\n\nWe hope you and your student(s) enjoyed learning about water!

We will learn about this and more in this video all about algae for kids! Algae (alga is the singular spelling) are a type of plant-like living things\rthat make their food just like all other plants, from sunlight by photosynthesis.\n\nAlgae are commonly found living in the sea, oceans,\rrivers, lakes, ponds, or even in aquariums. There\rare two different types of algae: macroalgae and\r microalgae. Macroalgae are something you are very\rfamiliar with-- seaweed. Microalgae are referred to as phytoplankton. Micro- means very small, so think of them as small plants that\rlive in the ocean, rivers, ponds, or lakes.\n\nThere are many different kinds of Algae from Seaweed, to Brown, Green and Red Algae and all have different purposes that we explore in the video!

We will learn about this and more in this video all about algae for kids! Algae (alga is the singular spelling) are a type of plant-like living things\rthat make their food just like all other plants, from sunlight by photosynthesis.\n\nAlgae are commonly found living in the sea, oceans,\rrivers, lakes, ponds, or even in aquariums. There\rare two different types of algae: macroalgae and\r microalgae. Macroalgae are something you are very\rfamiliar with-- seaweed. Microalgae are referred to as phytoplankton. Micro- means very small, so think of them as small plants that\rlive in the ocean, rivers, ponds, or lakes.\n\nThere are many different kinds of Algae from Seaweed, to Brown, Green and Red Algae and all have different purposes that we explore in the video!

You will discover some pretty interesting facts about the planet we live on! So let's get into it. How and why doe the earth look the way it does today? \n\nPangea was a supercontinent, meaning that all the continents we know of today were part of the same land mass. Keep in mind, this was nearly 300 million years ago. Scientists have discovered that the continents today are like big puzzle pieces that all fit together. They realized the possibility of a supercontinent when they discovered fossils of certain dinosaurs in areas that are currently separated by oceans.\n\nBut how did the continents split? The earth is made up of several different sections called plates. These tectonic plates in the earth's crust move incredibly slowly over the mantle layer of the planet. The constant movement of the plates changed what the land looked like on the surface. Sometimes the plates bumped each other. Other times they moved apart. And they also slid side by side. Over time\u2014millions and millions of years\u2014the continents we know of today separated more and more.\n\nWe hope you and your student(s) enjoyed learning about Pangea!

                    "description": "Learn to Talk with Ms Rachel with this Toddler Learning Video!\n\nThe toy used in this video has small parts and is not for children under 3 years old.  \n\nThis educational video for toddlers includes speech practice, learning colors, phonics, pretend play skills, simple songs, animals, first words, first sentences, letters and sign language! We will also learn colors with giant crayon surprises! We will open each color giant crayon and find fun giant crayon surprises that inspire us to sing simple songs that help with speech and language development, gestures, imitation and are so much fun! We\u2019ll learn each color of the rainbow with these fun, engaging surprises! Our songs for toddlers will also encourage kids to get up and move and exercise! \n\nSomething unique about our learning videos is a teacher, Ms Rachel, is on screen modeling language, gestures, pretend play and being incredibly interactive with viewers. We also show her mouth close up so children can focus on how sounds and words are formed. This may help children with speech development. \n\nIf you think your child has a speech delay, definitely talk to your pediatrician. You may qualify for free speech therapy through your state's early intervention program. You can also get evaluated by a speech therapist. For some of our videos, I worked with the brilliant speech language pathologists (speech therapists) at Chatterbox NYC. You can find them at www.chatterboxnyc.com I am not a speech therapist myself. I am a music teacher with a masters in music education. \n\nWe have many more baby learning videos, toddler learning videos and preschool learning videos. We are incredibly passionate about early childhood education! If you are looking for the best learning videos, you will see how much time, care and research we put into each toddler video we create. Rachel uses single words, simple sentences and speaks slowly so children can really hear the language. This video also includes a section of very slow speech practice which may be helpful for children with speech delays and apraxia.  We aim for our videos to be incredibly interactive and engaging, not passive watching because research shows that this is most beneficial. \n\nWe use simple songs, fun sounds, music, basic sign language, and first words to build vocabulary. I show gestures and signs because are they are incredibly important building blocks for language development. \n\nWe have many different kids of videos for babies and toddlers on our channel.  We have full baby music classes and full toddler music classes. We have many videos with fun baby songs and toddler songs, and we also have videos that aim to help with speech development and first words. We also have preschool videos for preschoolers. These are great videos for teaching toddlers preschool readiness skills! They are full of preschool lessons that are great for 1 year olds, 2 year olds, 3 year olds, 4 year olds and even 5 year olds or older! We also have preschool music classes. \n\nRachel teaches preschool music to young kids, toddlers, and babies and has a masters degree in music education from NYU. She has also been a toddler teacher at a school for children with special needs including autism, apraxia, speech delays, developmental delays, down syndrome and cerebral palsy. \n\nMany people are involved in designing our videos. On our team we have: speech-language pathologists, a reading specialist, a Broadway musician, an early childhood curriculum specialist, a child and family therapist, and award-winning songwriters! \n\nThis video is edited by Aron Accurso of Songs for Littles and Simone Kiseiel, the founder of Magic Dog Productions. \n\nThese are some of the best educational videos for kids you will find. Our Learn To Talk for Toddlers videos show First Words and functional speech for babies, toddlers, 1 year olds, 2 year olds, 3 year olds and older! \n\nWe put your baby first and not entertainment value. That is why there is no loud music during the presentation of words. \n\n#learntotalk #learncolors #toddlerlearningvideo #bestlearningvideofortoddlers #learningvideofortoddlers #crayonsurprises #giantcrayons #speechfortoddlers \n\n#learntotalkfortoddlers #firstwords #apraxia #speechdelay  #firstwordsforbabies #firstwordsfortoddlers #educationalvideos #flashcards #babies #toddlers #babiesfirstwords #phonics  #earlyintervention \n\nEven parents enjoy the educational videos we create. Our videos are wonderful for preschoolers and kindergarteners. Our videos are in English and we purposefully speak slowly and clearly for optimal learning. We hope you enjoy our English learning videos for toddlers.\n\n#SongsForLittles #speechdelay #learning #learn #learncolors #msrachel #toddlerlearningvideos #toddlers #speech #toddlerlearningvideos #kidssongs #songsforlittles #education #educational #learnenglish #toddler #toddlersongs #crayons #toys #toy #learntotalk",

                        "description": "Learn to Talk with Ms Rachel with this Toddler Learning Video!\n\nThe toy used in this video has small parts and is not for children under 3 years old.  \n\nThis educational video for toddlers includes speech practice, learning colors, phonics, pretend play skills, simple songs, animals, first words, first sentences, letters and sign language! We will also learn colors with giant crayon surprises! We will open each color giant crayon and find fun giant crayon surprises that inspire us to sing simple songs that help with speech and language development, gestures, imitation and are so much fun! We\u2019ll learn each color of the rainbow with these fun, engaging surprises! Our songs for toddlers will also encourage kids to get up and move and exercise! \n\nSomething unique about our learning videos is a teacher, Ms Rachel, is on screen modeling language, gestures, pretend play and being incredibly interactive with viewers. We also show her mouth close up so children can focus on how sounds and words are formed. This may help children with speech development. \n\nIf you think your child has a speech delay, definitely talk to your pediatrician. You may qualify for free speech therapy through your state's early intervention program. You can also get evaluated by a speech therapist. For some of our videos, I worked with the brilliant speech language pathologists (speech therapists) at Chatterbox NYC. You can find them at www.chatterboxnyc.com I am not a speech therapist myself. I am a music teacher with a masters in music education. \n\nWe have many more baby learning videos, toddler learning videos and preschool learning videos. We are incredibly passionate about early childhood education! If you are looking for the best learning videos, you will see how much time, care and research we put into each toddler video we create. Rachel uses single words, simple sentences and speaks slowly so children can really hear the language. This video also includes a section of very slow speech practice which may be helpful for children with speech delays and apraxia.  We aim for our videos to be incredibly interactive and engaging, not passive watching because research shows that this is most beneficial. \n\nWe use simple songs, fun sounds, music, basic sign language, and first words to build vocabulary. I show gestures and signs because are they are incredibly important building blocks for language development. \n\nWe have many different kids of videos for babies and toddlers on our channel.  We have full baby music classes and full toddler music classes. We have many videos with fun baby songs and toddler songs, and we also have videos that aim to help with speech development and first words. We also have preschool videos for preschoolers. These are great videos for teaching toddlers preschool readiness skills! They are full of preschool lessons that are great for 1 year olds, 2 year olds, 3 year olds, 4 year olds and even 5 year olds or older! We also have preschool music classes. \n\nRachel teaches preschool music to young kids, toddlers, and babies and has a masters degree in music education from NYU. She has also been a toddler teacher at a school for children with special needs including autism, apraxia, speech delays, developmental delays, down syndrome and cerebral palsy. \n\nMany people are involved in designing our videos. On our team we have: speech-language pathologists, a reading specialist, a Broadway musician, an early childhood curriculum specialist, a child and family therapist, and award-winning songwriters! \n\nThis video is edited by Aron Accurso of Songs for Littles and Simone Kiseiel, the founder of Magic Dog Productions. \n\nThese are some of the best educational videos for kids you will find. Our Learn To Talk for Toddlers videos show First Words and functional speech for babies, toddlers, 1 year olds, 2 year olds, 3 year olds and older! \n\nWe put your baby first and not entertainment value. That is why there is no loud music during the presentation of words. \n\n#learntotalk #learncolors #toddlerlearningvideo #bestlearningvideofortoddlers #learningvideofortoddlers #crayonsurprises #giantcrayons #speechfortoddlers \n\n#learntotalkfortoddlers #firstwords #apraxia #speechdelay  #firstwordsforbabies #firstwordsfortoddlers #educationalvideos #flashcards #babies #toddlers #babiesfirstwords #phonics  #earlyintervention \n\nEven parents enjoy the educational videos we create. Our videos are wonderful for preschoolers and kindergarteners. Our videos are in English and we purposefully speak slowly and clearly for optimal learning. We hope you enjoy our English learning videos for toddlers.\n\n#SongsForLittles #speechdelay #learning #learn #learncolors #msrachel #toddlerlearningvideos #toddlers #speech #toddlerlearningvideos #kidssongs #songsforlittles #education #educational #learnenglish #toddler #toddlersongs #crayons #toys #toy #learntotalk"

                    "description": "In this Preschool for Littles Bedtime Routine Special, we show a full bedtime routine, read some very special bedtime stories and then wind down with lullabies and relaxation techniques. Ms Rachel shares a bedtime routine song to make it easy to remember our whole routine! We know you will love bedtime with Ms. Rachel, Jules and Herbie! \n\nRoutines help children feel safe and secure. According to research, children who have bedtime routines take less time falling asleep, wake up less, sleep longer and go to sleep earlier. Even parents are shown to get more sleep when children have a bedtime routine.  A bedtime routine is a great way to bond with children and bedtime stories promote literacy. \n\nThis episode includes Raffi\u2019s hit \u201cBrush Your Teeth\u201d which is a wonderful teeth brushing song and many wonderful bedtime songs to use as lullabies such as \u201cTwinkle, Twinkle\u201d and \u201cFrere Jacques\u201d \n\nThe episode also includes a wonderful bedtime story for kids \u201cBlanket : Journey to Extreme Coziness\u201d by best selling author, Loryn Brantz. \n\nWe will meet one of Ms. Rachel\u2019s wonderful friends, Alice, and see her bedtime routine! \n\nAll of our preschool videos and toddler videos include learning standards for these age groups. This video includes phonics (introducing the B sound) counting to 10, and the ability to follow routines and directions, such as cleaning up. This video includes bedtime stories for toddlers and is a high quality toddler learning video that is research based. \n\nBedtime Song \n\nWe take a nice warm bath \nWe put our PJs on\nWe brush our teeth\nWe read a story, sing a song\nAnd then it\u2019s time to sleep \n\n#bedtimestories #bedtimestoriesfortoddlers #bedtimestory #bedtimestoryforkids #bedtime #bedtimeroutine #toddlerbedtimeroutine #preschoolforlittles #toddlerlearningvideo #bedtimesongs #lullabies #bedtimesongs #toddlerlearningvideo #preschoolvideos #videosforkids \n\n\u2665\ufe0e Subscribe to support our YouTube channel https://bit.ly/2YldegF   \n\u2665\ufe0e Visit our website\n\u2665\ufe0e Sign-up for our newsletter https://www.songsforlittles.com/mailinglist \n\u2665\ufe0e Like us on Facebook https://www.facebook.com/songsforlittles \n\u2665\ufe0e Follow us on Instagram https://www.instagram.com/songsforlittles/\n\n\"Georgie\" puppet  Copyright 2016 - David Fino & The Brooklyn Puppet Conspiracy.

She has also been a toddler teacher at a school for children with special needs including autism, apraxia, speech delays, developmental delays, down syndrome and cerebral palsy. She has worked in homes to support families with children with special needs. She believes all children are gifted, precious and our teachers as well! \n\nWe have many more baby learning videos, toddler learning videos and preschool learning videos on our YouTube page. We are incredibly passionate about early childhood education! We put a lot of time, care and research into each learning video for toddlers we create. Our videos are interactive screen time not passive screen time because research shows that this is most beneficial. We also have full baby music classes and full toddler music classes. \n\nWe use simple songs, music, basic sign language, and first words to build vocabulary. We also include social emotional learning. I show gestures and signs because are they are incredibly important building blocks for language development. Sign language will not impede speech development. Research shows that it enhances speech development. We have many videos with fun baby songs and toddler songs and videos that aim to help with speech development and first words. We also have preschool videos for preschoolers. These are great videos for teaching toddlers preschool readiness skills! They are full of preschool lessons that are great for 1 year olds, 2 year olds, 3 year olds, 4 year olds and even 5 year olds or older! We also have preschool music classes. \n\nMany people are involved in designing our videos. On our team we have: a speech-language pathologist, a reading specialist, a Broadway musician, an early childhood curriculum specialist, a child and family therapist, and award-winning songwriters! \n\nIf you have a baby, 1 year old, 2-year-old, 3-year-old, 4-year-old or 5-year-old, our channel is perfect for you! These are some of the best educational videos for kids you will find. Our Learn To Talk for Toddlers videos show First Words and functional speech may be helpful to children with speech delays or speech disorders. \n\nWe put your baby first and not entertainment value. Our videos are in English and we purposefully speak slowly and clearly for optimal learning. We hope you enjoy our English learning videos for toddlers.\n\n#videosfortoddlers #toddlerlearningvideo #learntotalk #speech #speechdelay #babysignlanguage #educationalvideosfortoddlers #babies #videosforbabies #toddlervideos #learncolors #learnnumbers #learnabcs #animalsounds",

                        "description": "In this Preschool for Littles Bedtime Routine Special, we show a full bedtime routine, read some very special bedtime stories and then wind down with lullabies and relaxation techniques. Ms Rachel shares a bedtime routine song to make it easy to remember our whole routine! We know you will love bedtime with Ms. Rachel, Jules and Herbie! \n\nRoutines help children feel safe and secure. According to research, children who have bedtime routines take less time falling asleep, wake up less, sleep longer and go to sleep earlier. Even parents are shown to get more sleep when children have a bedtime routine.  A bedtime routine is a great way to bond with children and bedtime stories promote literacy. \n\nThis episode includes Raffi\u2019s hit \u201cBrush Your Teeth\u201d which is a wonderful teeth brushing song and many wonderful bedtime songs to use as lullabies such as \u201cTwinkle, Twinkle\u201d and \u201cFrere Jacques\u201d \n\nThe episode also includes a wonderful bedtime story for kids \u201cBlanket : Journey to Extreme Coziness\u201d by best selling author, Loryn Brantz. \n\nWe will meet one of Ms. Rachel\u2019s wonderful friends, Alice, and see her bedtime routine! \n\nAll of our preschool videos and toddler videos include learning standards for these age groups. This video includes phonics (introducing the B sound) counting to 10, and the ability to follow routines and directions, such as cleaning up. This video includes bedtime stories for toddlers and is a high quality toddler learning video that is research based. \n\nBedtime Song \n\nWe take a nice warm bath \nWe put our PJs on\nWe brush our teeth\nWe read a story, sing a song\nAnd then it\u2019s time to sleep \n\n#bedtimestories #bedtimestoriesfortoddlers #bedtimestory #bedtimestoryforkids #bedtime #bedtimeroutine #toddlerbedtimeroutine #preschoolforlittles #toddlerlearningvideo #bedtimesongs #lullabies #bedtimesongs #toddlerlearningvideo #preschoolvideos #videosforkids \n\n\u2665\ufe0e Subscribe to support our YouTube channel https://bit.ly/2YldegF   \n\u2665\ufe0e Visit our website\n\u2665\ufe0e Sign-up for our newsletter https://www.songsforlittles.com/mailinglist \n\u2665\ufe0e Like us on Facebook https://www.facebook.com/songsforlittles \n\u2665\ufe0e Follow us on Instagram https://www.instagram.com/songsforlittles/\n\n\"Georgie\" puppet  Copyright 2016 - David Fino & The Brooklyn Puppet Conspiracy.

She has also been a toddler teacher at a school for children with special needs including autism, apraxia, speech delays, developmental delays, down syndrome and cerebral palsy. She has worked in homes to support families with children with special needs. She believes all children are gifted, precious and our teachers as well! \n\nWe have many more baby learning videos, toddler learning videos and preschool learning videos on our YouTube page. We are incredibly passionate about early childhood education! We put a lot of time, care and research into each learning video for toddlers we create. Our videos are interactive screen time not passive screen time because research shows that this is most beneficial. We also have full baby music classes and full toddler music classes. \n\nWe use simple songs, music, basic sign language, and first words to build vocabulary. We also include social emotional learning. I show gestures and signs because are they are incredibly important building blocks for language development. Sign language will not impede speech development. Research shows that it enhances speech development. We have many videos with fun baby songs and toddler songs and videos that aim to help with speech development and first words. We also have preschool videos for preschoolers. These are great videos for teaching toddlers preschool readiness skills! They are full of preschool lessons that are great for 1 year olds, 2 year olds, 3 year olds, 4 year olds and even 5 year olds or older! We also have preschool music classes. \n\nMany people are involved in designing our videos. On our team we have: a speech-language pathologist, a reading specialist, a Broadway musician, an early childhood curriculum specialist, a child and family therapist, and award-winning songwriters! \n\nIf you have a baby, 1 year old, 2-year-old, 3-year-old, 4-year-old or 5-year-old, our channel is perfect for you! These are some of the best educational videos for kids you will find. Our Learn To Talk for Toddlers videos show First Words and functional speech may be helpful to children with speech delays or speech disorders. \n\nWe put your baby first and not entertainment value. Our videos are in English and we purposefully speak slowly and clearly for optimal learning. We hope you enjoy our English learning videos for toddlers.\n\n#videosfortoddlers #toddlerlearningvideo #learntotalk #speech #speechdelay #babysignlanguage #educationalvideosfortoddlers #babies #videosforbabies #toddlervideos #learncolors #learnnumbers #learnabcs #animalsounds"

The couple had no children, and being lonely, the woman decided to make a boy of gingerbread. She carefully mixed the batter, rolled out the dough, and cut out out a very nice gingerbread man.

He had a beautiful daughter named Lisa. The miller lied to the King about Lisa who could turn straw into gold. The King was so delightful and took Lisa to the tower room which full of straw and a spinning wheel. The King demanded Lisa to turn the straw into gold in three days or else she would be sentenced to death. Lisa was very sad as she would not able to grant the King\u2019s whishes. Then, a stranger appeared suddenly and offered Lisa a help. The stranger was known as Rumpelstiltskin who spun straw into gold and in return Lisa gave him her necklace and ring. The King became so greedy and wanted more gold. Then, the King asked his servant to search for every last wisp of straw in the countryside so that Lisa could turn the straw into gold and promised her that she would become his queen if she granted his wishes or else he cut off her head. As Lisa was sitting sadly on the floor, Rumpelstiltskin appeared for the third time and offered his last help to Lisa. In return, Lisa had nothing to reward him. Rumpelstiltskin spun the straw into gold and for a promise Lisa would give her first-born child to him after she became a queen. After a year, the King and Lisa had a baby son. Rumpelstiltskin returned to claim his reward. The queen was frightened and offered him all the wealth she had if she could keep the child. Rumpelstiltskin refused and finally agreed to give up his claim to the child if the queen could guess his name in three days. At first she failed, but before the final night, her parents followed Rumpelstiltskin to the woods and they overheard him singing. While he was singing and hopping around the fire, they discovered his name as Rumpelstiltskin. When the dwarf came to the queen on the third day and she revealed his name, Rumpelstiltskin lost his bargain. He was so angry and stamped the floor so hard and vanished in a puff of smoke. Lisa\u2019s father learnt his lesson and he promised her that he would never boast again.\n\n#rumpelstiltskin #fairytale #kids #shortstory #shortstories #fairytales",

                    "description": "The Gingerbread Man (also known as The Gingerbread Boy or The Gingerbread Runner) is a fairy tale about a gingerbread man's escape from various pursuers and his eventual demise between the jaws of a fox. \n\nStory : Once upon a time, an old woman and her husband lived alone in a little old house. The couple had no children, and being lonely, the woman decided to make a boy of gingerbread. She carefully mixed the batter, rolled out the dough, and cut out out a very nice gingerbread man. She added sugar icing for his hair, mouth, and clothes, and she used candy chips for buttons and eyes. What a fine looking gingerbread man he was! The old woman put him in the oven to bake. After he was fully done, she slowly opened the oven door. Up jumped the gingerbread man, and he ran out the door saying,\"Run, run, as fast as you can! You can't catch me! I'm the Gingerbread Man!\"\nThe old woman and the old man ran after him, but they could not catch him.\n\n#gingerbreadman #fairytales #gingerbreadmanfullstory #gingerbreadmen #fairytale #gingerbreadmanfullmovie - The Gingerbread Man Full Story | Fairy Tales\n\nClick below to Subscribe to our Channel for Regular Videos! - \nhttp://www.youtube.com/user/kidsanimations?sub_confirmation=1\n\nBecome a KidsAnimations Fan on Facebook:\nhttps://www.facebook.com/kidscornerr?fref=nf\n\nGIVE YOUR KIDS A BEST START IN LIFE..

With their unique elemental powers of Earth, Fire, and Water, they wear bright capes and masks, ready to help people in need.\n\nOne day, Max the farmer is feeling down because his soil is bad and his fruits and vegetables won't grow. But here comes Jannie, the Green Ranger! She uses her magical Earth power to make Max's farm green and bountiful again. Max is so happy and thankful!\n\nMeanwhile, an evil but silly villain named Thanos wants the Colorful Rangers' powerful stones. He sneaks around, stealing their stones one by one, and uses their powers to make trouble for everyone.\n\nThe Colorful Rangers won't give up, though! They team up and bravely face Thanos to get their magical stones back. During a thrilling battle, Eric, the Red Ranger, cleverly takes back the Blue Stone using a bow and arrow.\n\nJust as things are getting intense, Thanos' mom, Beth, shows up! She scolds her mischievous son and makes him return the stolen stones to the Colorful Rangers. Thanos is embarrassed, and with a pout, he leaves with his mom through a sparkling portal.\n\nWith their powers back, the Colorful Rangers are ready for more adventures and to keep helping others. And as for Thanos, well, he might just try to cause trouble again someday!\n\nSubscribe for notifications to new videos: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCgFXm4TI8htWmCyJ6cVPG_A?sub_confirmation=1\n\nCheck out our latest videos playlist: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsHnS3mZglg&list=PL5gq3QGk5j3hRwpMNKQ9L5NyUt3FiTmSy"

Feeling sorry, Eric offers his purple ice cream, but Ellie, disappointed, refuses. They both start making their own colored slimes - Ellie's pink and Eric's purple. When Uncle Gristle arrives, he causes chaos by bursting their balloons and tricking them into a time-out room with Mr. Cloud, who's lost his ability to make rainbows.\n\nUsing teamwork, Ellie and Eric escape using their slime and set a playful trap for Gristle.
