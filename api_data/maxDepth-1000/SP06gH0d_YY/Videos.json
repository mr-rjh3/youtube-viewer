Naturally when you mix hand crafted bosses and overpowered quest items into a game you make it so that the player gets them at a time when they are only normally powered. However as EldenRing Is an openworld rpg it means we can glitch and bug our way across the world map dodging bosses and farming runes in the best rune farm spots to get the best weapons in elden ring. Naturally today we are discovering that magic is very broken. Heck maybe elden ring is broken if you bug your way into stun locking a huge dragon boss with a deathstar who am I to judge. So its time to get overpowered at the very start of the game ignore all the best armor in elden wring and instead use the spiffing brit cursed elden wring guide on how to break the game! \n\nIf you want other potential overpowered builds then @BoomstickGaming  has a great early build. @ymfah  Has a VERY strong exploit build and @RTGame  Just did something wrong and OP... So go give their elden ring videos a watch! There is also a new overpowered infinite health vampire build that has recently surfaced and is likely to help fix the temperamental god mode glitch that I showed off today!\n\nWhat you have seen here today is part of a fantastic perfectly balanced series on youtube where I go from game to game and break them with wacky exploits to gain things like unlimited gold.

A large influence on this series has come from Valefisk and The Killian Experience. \n\nSo sit back relax and enjoy this elden ring gameplay where we get infinite runes, infinite health and infinite damage by turning our self into a mage death star that can 1 hit most bosses in seconds! \n\n00:00 - Coming Up!\n00:13 - Intro\n01:03 - The return of Seymour Clevarge!\n02:58 - Becomming an Immortal\n04:47 - Exploring the world\n06:30 - Teleporting to our next destination\n08:28 - Farming Boulders\n10:15 - URGENT APPEAL\n10:37 - Levelling up using boulders\n12:06 - Moving to our next destination\n13:38 - Getting the mega spell\n15:50 - Infinite Magic!!\n17:40 - Fighting a Dragon\n19:05 - Fighting Birdman!\n21:10 - UNLIMITED POWER!\n23:02 - Outro\n24:04 - Patreons\n\nJoin this channel to get access to perks:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCRHXUZ0BxbkU2MYZgsuFgkQ/join\nPatreon: https://www.patreon.com/Spiffing\nTwitter: @thespiffingbrit\nDiscord: https://discord.gg/spiffing\n\ntitle: Elden Ring Is A Perfectly Balanced Game - Magic Is Very Broken\n\n#EldenRing #Overpowered #Exploit If you want to support the channel please consider buying these lovely items I can personally vouch for below!\n\n\u2615\ufe0f Yorkshire Tea GOLD (BIG BOX) \u2615\ufe0f\nUS: https://amzn.to/47s5r10 UK: https://amzn.to/3sjS2sX \n\n\ud83e\uded6TEAPOT\ud83e\uded6\nUS: https://amzn.to/40E4Jvh UK: https://amzn.to/40AmonF\n\n\ud83c\udfa4 MY MIC (Blue Yeti)\ud83c\udfa4\nUS: https://amzn.to/47dB1Q9 UK:https://amzn.to/3sx3Yri\n\n\ud83d\udda5\ufe0f MY MONITOR (Asus 27\u201d)\ud83d\udda5\ufe0f\nUK: https://amzn.to/49FHaXc US: https://amzn.to/3MK12hR\n\nIf you\u2019d rather pick it up from you local Tesco, please do!

                    "description": "Crusader Kings 3 Royal Court Has Just released and with this latest DLC update we have seen a culture system overhaul and the addition of overpowered artifacts. Now I could make a tier list or top 10 list of cultures and artefacts or alternatively I could just create a god by becoming a viking raider in india who will then create a culture of elephant riding space marines that cannot be stopped in combat as they have a knight effectiveness of over 500%! Crusader Kings 3 / Crusader Kings III Is the latest entry into the crusader kings series. So sit back and enjoy this divorce simulator which has been disguised under the name of a grand strategy game CK3! I loved playing CK2 and I am excited to be able to show off this next in CK3! But is this new game Crusader Kings 3 a perfectly balanced game with no exploits or is making money by becoming a god is overpowered! Well lets see what The Spiffing Brit has to show us today in Crusader Kings III as sure you can do ck3 tall or you can just destroy the world\n\nWhat you have seen here today is part of a fantastic perfectly balanced series on youtube where I go from game to game and break them with wacky exploits to gain things like unlimited gold. If you enjoyed this then be sure to check out more. The style is similar to RT game and callmekevin in parts. A large influence on this series has come from Valefisk and The Killian Experience. \n\nSo sit back relax and enjoy this Crusader Kings 3 challenge! How on earth can one english bugger beat CK III with the power of space marines!!!\n\ntitle: HOW TO BECOME GOD - Crusader Kings 3 Royal Court Is A Perfectly Balanced Game With No Exploits\n\nJoin this channel to get access to perks:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCRHXUZ0BxbkU2MYZgsuFgkQ/join\nPatreon: https://www.patreon.com/Spiffing\nTwitter: @thespiffingbrit\nDiscord: https://discord.gg/spiffing\n\n00:00 - Coming Up\n00:17 - Intro\n02:09 - Getting Started\n03:39 - Life & Death in the family\n05:20 - Birth of the Tea Drinkers!\n07:14 - Planning our Kingdom\n08:28 - Our new Court\n09:58 - Mega Knights!\n11:53 - MANDITORY AD BREAK!\n12:17 - Making our Knights even stronger!\n14:29 - Creation of the Space Marines\n16:28 - Yorkshire Tea Religion\n18:26 - The Yorkeshireism Schism\n19.35 - Attack of the Space Marines\n21:21 - Crusade time!\n22:58 - Squashing the Crusade\n24:09 - Outro\n24:31 - PATREONS!\n\n#CK3 #God #Funny",

                        "description": "Crusader Kings 3 Royal Court Has Just released and with this latest DLC update we have seen a culture system overhaul and the addition of overpowered artifacts. Now I could make a tier list or top 10 list of cultures and artefacts or alternatively I could just create a god by becoming a viking raider in india who will then create a culture of elephant riding space marines that cannot be stopped in combat as they have a knight effectiveness of over 500%! Crusader Kings 3 / Crusader Kings III Is the latest entry into the crusader kings series. So sit back and enjoy this divorce simulator which has been disguised under the name of a grand strategy game CK3! I loved playing CK2 and I am excited to be able to show off this next in CK3! But is this new game Crusader Kings 3 a perfectly balanced game with no exploits or is making money by becoming a god is overpowered! Well lets see what The Spiffing Brit has to show us today in Crusader Kings III as sure you can do ck3 tall or you can just destroy the world\n\nWhat you have seen here today is part of a fantastic perfectly balanced series on youtube where I go from game to game and break them with wacky exploits to gain things like unlimited gold. If you enjoyed this then be sure to check out more. The style is similar to RT game and callmekevin in parts. A large influence on this series has come from Valefisk and The Killian Experience. \n\nSo sit back relax and enjoy this Crusader Kings 3 challenge! How on earth can one english bugger beat CK III with the power of space marines!!!\n\ntitle: HOW TO BECOME GOD - Crusader Kings 3 Royal Court Is A Perfectly Balanced Game With No Exploits\n\nJoin this channel to get access to perks:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCRHXUZ0BxbkU2MYZgsuFgkQ/join\nPatreon: https://www.patreon.com/Spiffing\nTwitter: @thespiffingbrit\nDiscord: https://discord.gg/spiffing\n\n00:00 - Coming Up\n00:17 - Intro\n02:09 - Getting Started\n03:39 - Life & Death in the family\n05:20 - Birth of the Tea Drinkers!\n07:14 - Planning our Kingdom\n08:28 - Our new Court\n09:58 - Mega Knights!\n11:53 - MANDITORY AD BREAK!\n12:17 - Making our Knights even stronger!\n14:29 - Creation of the Space Marines\n16:28 - Yorkshire Tea Religion\n18:26 - The Yorkeshireism Schism\n19.35 - Attack of the Space Marines\n21:21 - Crusade time!\n22:58 - Squashing the Crusade\n24:09 - Outro\n24:31 - PATREONS!\n\n#CK3 #God #Funny"

                    "description": "A thousand years ago, the Angkor Empire conquered large swathes of Southeast Asia to become one of the region's greatest powers. Host Peter Lee journeys through Cambodia to learn how life in Angkor still revolves around the ebb and flow of the floodwaters that come with the yearly monsoons, and how the ancient Khmer overcame the environmental challenge and became masters of engineering, building canals and reservoirs to act as flood defences and irrigation channels to boost their rice harvests. The Khmer also built a network of roads to exert their authority far and wide, and created a social system of education, taxation, and even healthcare that revolved around temples. Peter visits the Angkor Empire's crowning glory \u2014 Angkor Wat \u2014 the world's largest religious monument to see how it was built, and how intricate carvings detailing life a thousand years ago are linked with a modern Cambodian tradition.\n\nFor more, SUBSCRIBE to CNA INSIDER! \nhttps://cna.asia/insideryoutubesub\n\n==========================================================\nAbout the series: Host Peter Lee explores the history of four Southeast Asian empires that made their mark on the world.

Host Peter Lee journeys through Cambodia to learn how life in Angkor still revolves around the ebb and flow of the floodwaters that come with the yearly monsoons, and how the ancient Khmer overcame the environmental challenge and became masters of engineering, building canals and reservoirs to act as flood defences and irrigation channels to boost their rice harvests. The Khmer also built a network of roads to exert their authority far and wide, and created a social system of education, taxation, and even healthcare that revolved around temples. Peter visits the Angkor Empire's crowning glory \u2014 Angkor Wat \u2014 the world's largest religious monument to see how it was built, and how intricate carvings detailing life a thousand years ago are linked with a modern Cambodian tradition.\n\nFor more, SUBSCRIBE to CNA INSIDER! \nhttps://cna.asia/insideryoutubesub\n\n==========================================================\nAbout the series: Host Peter Lee explores the history of four Southeast Asian empires that made their mark on the world.

The coup led to the ousting of democracy icon, Aung San Suu Kyi and brought Myanmar's decade long experiment with democracy to a crashing halt. A mass uprising soon broke out across the country. The security forces responded by launching a brutal crackdown against the protesters, turning some areas of the capital, Yangon into battle zones.\n\nBut why did the army stage a coup and shatter the hopes and dreams of many of its citizens? Will the violence and protests in the streets help restore democracy in Myanmar?\n\nFor greater INSIGHT into issues affecting Asia: \nhttps://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLkMf14VQEvTaHr6oTqYbWqKOsmcveuhca\n\n===============\nABOUT THE SHOW: Insight investigates and analyses topical issues that impact Asia and the rest of the world. \n==========================\n#CNAInsider #CNAInsiderInvestigates #Myanmar #MyanmarCoup #MilitaryCoup #AungSanSuuKyi\n\n\nFor more, SUBSCRIBE to CNA INSIDER\nhttps://cna.asia/insideryoutubesub\n\nFollow CNA INSIDER on:\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/cnainsider/\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/cnainsider/\nWebsite: https://cna.asia/cnainsider",

                        "description": "In the early hours of February 1st, 2021, the Myanmar military known as the Tatmadaw seized power of the country. The coup led to the ousting of democracy icon, Aung San Suu Kyi and brought Myanmar's decade long experiment with democracy to a crashing halt. A mass uprising soon broke out across the country.

Will the violence and protests in the streets help restore democracy in Myanmar?\n\nFor greater INSIGHT into issues affecting Asia: \nhttps://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLkMf14VQEvTaHr6oTqYbWqKOsmcveuhca\n\n===============\nABOUT THE SHOW: Insight investigates and analyses topical issues that impact Asia and the rest of the world. \n==========================\n#CNAInsider #CNAInsiderInvestigates #Myanmar #MyanmarCoup #MilitaryCoup #AungSanSuuKyi\n\n\nFor more, SUBSCRIBE to CNA INSIDER\nhttps://cna.asia/insideryoutubesub\n\nFollow CNA INSIDER on:\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/cnainsider/\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/cnainsider/\nWebsite: https://cna.asia/cnainsider"

This is the story of the murder of King Feisal II and how it changed Iraq and the world forever.\n\nSpecial thanks to: Philip Eagleton; HRH Prince Osman Rifat Ibrahim; Colonel Timor Daghistani; Tamara Daghistani Sadoun\n\nDr. Mark Felton is a well-known British historian, the author of 22 non-fiction books, including bestsellers 'Zero Night' and 'Castle of the Eagles', both currently being developed into movies in Hollywood.

Mazur went undercover for the US Drug Enforcement Administration, the Internal Revenue Service intelligence division, and the Customs Service.\n\nIn Operation C-Chase, Mazur successfully infiltrated the Medell\u00edn cartel by posing as a wealthy, mob-connected businessman named Robert Musella. He established connections with Pablo Escobar's lawyer Gonzalo Mora and Escobar's trafficker Roberto Alcaino. At the height of its power, the cartel is estimated to have supplied over 80% of all cocaine shipped to the US, around 15 tons a day.\n\nIn Operation Promo, Mazur posed as an Italian American businessman named Robert Baldasare to expose money-laundering networks associated with the Cali cartel. At its peak, the Cali cartel is estimated to have produced 80% of the world's cocaine supply. It was controlled by Gilberto Rodr\u00edguez Orejuela, Miguel Rodr\u00edguez Orejuela, Pacho Herrera, and Jos\u00e9 Santacruz Londo\u00f1o.\n\nMazur is the author of \"The Infiltrator,\" which became a New York Times bestseller and spawned a 2016 film of the same title, starring Bryan Cranston (as Mazur), John Leguizamo, and Diane Kruger.
