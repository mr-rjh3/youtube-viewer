                    "description": "The Spartans chronicles the rise and fall of one of the most extreme civilisations the world has ever witnessed. A civilization that was founded on discipline, sacrifice and frugality where the onus was on the collective and the goal was to create the perfect state, and the perfect warrior.  Classical historian Bettany Hughes reveals the secrets and complexities of everyday Spartan life: homosexuality was compulsory, money was outlawed, equality was enforced, weak boys were put to death and women enjoyed a level of social and sexual freedom that was unheard of in the ancient world. It was a nation of fearsome fighters where a glorious death was treasured. This can be aptly demonstrated by the kamikaze last stand at Thermopylae, where King Leonidas and his warriors fought with swords, hands and teeth to fend off the Persian invaders and show the rest of the world what it meant to be Spartan.    Sparta was ruthlessly militaristic and founded on a belief that good order and justice protected against chaos and lawlessness. Policed by secret spies the society was supported by a nation of slaves so all Spartan men had to do was fight. Boys were indoctrinated with the Spartan code of death and glory, separated from their mothers at seven and left to fend for themselves. It led Aristotle to comment that Sparta \"turned its children into animals.\" The training continued throughout adolescence, the most able boys being let loose as death squads preying on the slave population to keep them quiet.  It cannot lay claim to the philosophers or artists of Athens but Sparta contributed as much to western civilisation as Athens did. Indeed it was Sparta, not Athens that was the first city to offer citizenship to its inhabitants. To many, the ideals formed 2500 years ago in Sparta can be seen as a fore-runner of modern-day totalitarianism.  By setting out to create a perfect society protected by perfect warriors, Sparta made an enemy of change. A collapsing birth-rate, too few warriors, rebellious slaves, and outdated attitudes to weaponry and warfare combined to sow the seeds of Sparta's destruction. Eventually the once great warrior state was reduced to a stop for Roman tourists who came to view the bizarre sado-masochistic rituals.

                        "description": "The Spartans chronicles the rise and fall of one of the most extreme civilisations the world has ever witnessed. A civilization that was founded on discipline, sacrifice and frugality where the onus was on the collective and the goal was to create the perfect state, and the perfect warrior.  Classical historian Bettany Hughes reveals the secrets and complexities of everyday Spartan life: homosexuality was compulsory, money was outlawed, equality was enforced, weak boys were put to death and women enjoyed a level of social and sexual freedom that was unheard of in the ancient world. It was a nation of fearsome fighters where a glorious death was treasured. This can be aptly demonstrated by the kamikaze last stand at Thermopylae, where King Leonidas and his warriors fought with swords, hands and teeth to fend off the Persian invaders and show the rest of the world what it meant to be Spartan.    In the final episode the war between Sparta and Athens reaches a brutal and bloody climax. Sparta finally emerged victorious; now the most powerful city-state in Greece, Sparta became an imperial power. But under the fascinating, flawed King Agesilaus, the dreams of the Spartan Utopia came crashing down.  It cannot lay claim to the philosophers or artists of Athens but Sparta contributed as much to western civilisation as Athens did. Indeed it was Sparta, not Athens that was the first city to offer citizenship to its inhabitants. To many, the ideals formed 2500 years ago in Sparta can be seen as a fore-runner of modern-day totalitarianism.  By setting out to create a perfect society protected by perfect warriors, Sparta made an enemy of change. A collapsing birth-rate, too few warriors, rebellious slaves, and outdated attitudes to weaponry and warfare combined to sow the seeds of Sparta's destruction. Eventually the once great warrior state was reduced to a stop for Roman tourists who came to view the bizarre sado-masochistic rituals.

This famous clash between the Greeks and Persians is always mentioned as a major point in studies of the Greco Persian Wars. And yet once mention, the narrative often jumps to the next clash at the Battle of Salamis. Here we choose to linger upon the battlefield itself to see what was the fate of the defeated Greeks and how both the Persians and Greek Allies plotted their next moves. This involves the slaughter of the 300 spartans, the corpse of Leonidas, the story of the hidden dead, the branding of the captives and more.\n\nIn follow up episodes we will cover the rest of the Second Greco Persian War with the Battle Salamis, the Battle of Plataea, and the counter-offensive against the Persian Empire.\n\nYou can learn about the aftermath of other famous battles here:\nThe Aftermath of Carrhae https://youtu.be/zHpth20N174\nThe Aftermath of Teutoburg https://youtu.be/3_Z2AnIpgOc\n\nTime Stamps:\n00:00 Intro\n01:35 Road to Thermopylae\n04:43 Battle of Thermopylae\n07:29 The Site of Battle\n10:39 Advance of the Persians\n16:05 The Sack of Athens\n\nCredits:\nResearch = Dr. Roel Koninendijk\nScript = Dr. Roel Koninendijk\nNarration = Invicta\nArt = Penta Limited\n\n#history \n#documentary \n#300",

Signup for a three-month subscription and get an additional three months for free! \u200b https://go.babbel.com/6m3-youtube-invicta-dec-2019/default\n\nIn this documentary episode we explore the Greco-Persian wars to understand why the Persians failed to conquer Greece. The video begins with a historical overview of the Achaemenid Persian Empire and then an analysis of the Ionian Revolt which led to war. We then look at what the Persian army of Darius and Xerxes wished to achieve and see to what extent these objectives were met. This includes looking at the Battle of Marathon, Thermopylae, Salamis, Mykale, and more which featured Greek armies of Athens, Sparta and more. You can learn more about the battle of Marathon in this video by the Armchair Historian: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2cubGxusJhw\n\nWe conclude with a discussion of why the Persians ultimately failed. This analysis corrects traditional narratives which portray the factors incorrectly.\n\nBibliography:\n'Neither the Less Valorous Nor the Weaker': Persian Military Might and the Battle of Plataia by Roel Konijnendijk\nH. van Wees, 'Herodotus and the past', in E.

The video begins with a historical overview of the Achaemenid Persian Empire and then an analysis of the Ionian Revolt which led to war. We then look at what the Persian army of Darius and Xerxes wished to achieve and see to what extent these objectives were met. This includes looking at the Battle of Marathon, Thermopylae, Salamis, Mykale, and more which featured Greek armies of Athens, Sparta and more. You can learn more about the battle of Marathon in this video by the Armchair Historian: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2cubGxusJhw\n\nWe conclude with a discussion of why the Persians ultimately failed. This analysis corrects traditional narratives which portray the factors incorrectly.\n\nBibliography:\n'Neither the Less Valorous Nor the Weaker': Persian Military Might and the Battle of Plataia by Roel Konijnendijk\nH. van Wees, 'Herodotus and the past', in E.

The first 100 people to go to https://www.blinkist.com/invicta are going to get unlimited access for 1 week to try it out. You\u2019ll also get 25% off if you want the full membership.\n\nIn this history documentary we recap the history of Sparta. This began long ago in the Bronze age which saw a rather glacial period of development that slowed even further in the Greek dark ages. However during the Archaic period a series of four villages eventually banded together to form a loose urban center that would later be called Sparta. They used their collective might to first dominate the local area, conquering the valley of Laconia before taking over neighboring Messenia over the course of the 8th and 7th centuries BC. During the 6th century BC it went on to undergo a series of reforms that saw the emergence of the Laws of Lycurgus and a more stark division between the citizen and non-citizen groups. This set the stage for Sparta to use its might to form the Peloponnesian League which collectively had the most powerful land army in all of Greece.\n\nThus in the 5th century BC, Sparta was able to take a commanding role in the Greco-Persian wars and truly shine in the battles of Thermopylae and Plataea. It would then go on to win the Peloponnesian War against Athens and become the master of Greece. This would be the pinnacle of its rise to power. However this would be fatally undermined by a cratering citizen population which soon led to a dramatic fall from grace.

The first 100 people to go to https://www.blinkist.com/invicta are going to get unlimited access for 1 week to try it out. You\u2019ll also get 25% off if you want the full membership.\n\nIn this history documentary we recap the history of Sparta. This began long ago in the Bronze age which saw a rather glacial period of development that slowed even further in the Greek dark ages. However during the Archaic period a series of four villages eventually banded together to form a loose urban center that would later be called Sparta. They used their collective might to first dominate the local area, conquering the valley of Laconia before taking over neighboring Messenia over the course of the 8th and 7th centuries BC. During the 6th century BC it went on to undergo a series of reforms that saw the emergence of the Laws of Lycurgus and a more stark division between the citizen and non-citizen groups. This set the stage for Sparta to use its might to form the Peloponnesian League which collectively had the most powerful land army in all of Greece.\n\nThus in the 5th century BC, Sparta was able to take a commanding role in the Greco-Persian wars and truly shine in the battles of Thermopylae and Plataea. It would then go on to win the Peloponnesian War against Athens and become the master of Greece. This would be the pinnacle of its rise to power. However this would be fatally undermined by a cratering citizen population which soon led to a dramatic fall from grace. It would take several hundred years but eventually Sparta would be able to pick itself back up, this time as a tourist attraction dedicated to its glorious past. We cover the ways in which this occurred and its a fascinating look into an otherwise forgotten part of the history of Sparta.\n\nBibliography and Suggested Reading:\n\u201cSpartans: A New History\u201d, by Nigel M.

The video begins with a history of Sparta staring from its slow development during the bronze age and emergence as a regional power in the early archaic. At this points its armies featured bands of elite armored warriors accompanied by their lightly armed retinues. Using these forces, Sparta was able to gain control of the communities to its south in Laconia and to its west in Messenia. These wars made Sparta the largest polis in all of Greece. However such vast territories were difficult to manage and were subject to frequent uprisings. Historians now believe that around the 6th century, Spartan government and society was thus reformed to better deal with its domestic issues. This mean grouping its subjects into the classes of Helots or Perioikoi whilst more strictly controlling what it meant to be Spartan. Through these changes the army was reformed into one of a massed militia whereby the whole army would fight on foot. Thus Sparta's previously mounted forces of the Hippeis dismounted to join their comrades and became the Royal Guard who defended the King of Sparta in battle.\n\nThe sparta documentary then covers the equipment of the guard which was typical of most greek army forces. We then discuss how guardsmen were recruited through a selection process each year and what sorts of spartan training and spartan workout activities they took part in. The video then discusses their military tactics and role in hoplite warfare. Finally we then cover the service history of the guard which stretches from the Greco Persian wars to the Peloponnesian war. This includes discussions of the 300 spartans at the battle of Thermopylae, the battle of Mantinea, and the battle of Leuctra against Thebes and the Sacred Band.\n\nBibliography\nT.

This includes a discussion of the battle of Tegyra where they defeated a superior Spartan force and the famous battle of Leuctra where the Sacred Band of Thebes helped defeat a spartan army.

In other videos we covered the War Elephants of Carthage, the Numidian Cavalry, and the Balearic Slingers.\n\nThe documentary begins with an overview of the history of Carthage and the evolution of the Carthaginian Army. The Punic state began as a small Phoenecian colony in North Africa with forces of citizen soldiers who very much resembled eastern troops. Next came the rise of Carthage. As the city of Carthage grew so too did its army which appears to have also become more well equipped. The army of Carthage was soon deploying its own heavy hoplite infantry, cavalry, and even chariots on the battlefield in its conquest of the Mediterranean. At the same time however, Carthage also began to hire mercenaries and raise auxiliaries which slowly replaced its native forces. This trend continued until the army of Carthage was primarily composed of foreign troops. However Punic men still served in the army as officers and cavalrymen. Some citizens still served in the infantry and it appears that it is from this last remaining bastion that the Sacred Band of Carthage emerged. Its name actually comes to us from the ancient Greeks who compared it to the Sacred Band of Thebes.\n\nNext we discuss the military equipment of the Sacred Band of Carthage which included richly decorated armour and weapons. We then turn to talk about their training and tactics as well as their service history which included participating in the Punic-Sicilian Wars against the greeks. While we don't have evidence of them participating in the Punic Wars against the Roman army, it is possible that they were present during the 3 invasions of africa and therefore would have fought in the Battle of Zama and the Siege of Carthage.\n\n#History\n#Carthage\n#UnitsOfHistory\n\nResearch: Vaughn Fenton\nScript: Vaughn Fenton\nNarration: Guy Michaels\nProduction: PentaLimited",

                    "description": "A Units of History Documentary on the Silver Shields - Veterans of the Macedonian Army! The first 100 people to go to https://www.blinkist.com/invicta are going to get unlimited access for 1 week to try it out. You\u2019ll also get 25% off if you want the full membership.\n\nIn this animated documentary we follow the story of one of the most elite units of history, the Argyraspides : the Silver Shields. We begin the video by taking a look back at their institutional origins. This can be traced back to the early practice in Macedon of having bodyguard units of Hetairoi protect the king in court and on the battlefield. Eventually these would be expanded to form elite units of horse and foot companions during the reforms of Philip the second of Macedon. \n\nWhen Alexander the Great took over however he would extend the title of Foot Companion to the entire 6 unit block of Macedonian levy pikemen. The previous elite units which had held that title would now be referred to as the Hypaspitai, or shield bearers. 3,000 of these accompanied his army in the invasion of the Achaemenid Empire. They would take up the right flank in the pitched Battle of Granicus River, the Battle of Issus, and the Battle of Gaugamela. However they were an extremely flexible force that could also be embedded in the cavalry, sent over rough terrain to flank the enemy, and broken into small groups for special missions.

                        "description": "A Units of History Documentary on the Silver Shields - Veterans of the Macedonian Army! The first 100 people to go to https://www.blinkist.com/invicta are going to get unlimited access for 1 week to try it out. You\u2019ll also get 25% off if you want the full membership.\n\nIn this animated documentary we follow the story of one of the most elite units of history, the Argyraspides : the Silver Shields. We begin the video by taking a look back at their institutional origins. This can be traced back to the early practice in Macedon of having bodyguard units of Hetairoi protect the king in court and on the battlefield. Eventually these would be expanded to form elite units of horse and foot companions during the reforms of Philip the second of Macedon. \n\nWhen Alexander the Great took over however he would extend the title of Foot Companion to the entire 6 unit block of Macedonian levy pikemen. The previous elite units which had held that title would now be referred to as the Hypaspitai, or shield bearers. 3,000 of these accompanied his army in the invasion of the Achaemenid Empire. They would take up the right flank in the pitched Battle of Granicus River, the Battle of Issus, and the Battle of Gaugamela. However they were an extremely flexible force that could also be embedded in the cavalry, sent over rough terrain to flank the enemy, and broken into small groups for special missions. In siege battles they also proved exceptional when it came to storming operations like in the Siege of Tyre and the Siege of Halicarnassus.\n\nAfter many years of fighting, these veteran Hypaspists would find them joining Alexander the Great on his campaigns into India. It would be here that they would finally adopt their famed Silver Shields and become the Argyraspides. We cover their history over the remainder of the campaigns of Alexander the Great and their subsequent involvement in the Wars of the Diadochi. This would involve many massive battles such as Paraitakene and Gabiene where they would continue their unbroken string of victories!

                    "description": "A history documentary on the Spies of the Roman Army!\nThe first 100 people to go to https://www.blinkist.com/invicta are going to get unlimited access for 1 week to try it out. You\u2019ll also get 25% off if you want the full membership.\n\nIn this Units of History episode we take a look at the Speculatores, Spies of the Roman Army. We begin with a discussion of the early history of Rome and the misconception that these early armies of the Monarchy and Republic did not employ any form of covert operations or deception. This moralistic narrative often gets trotted out by ancient authors who want to elevate early Rome as some purer, more honorable society. However this strains credulity when you consider that Rome never would have survived let along risen to power without the use of intelligence operations. To prove this point we dive examples from their military history where commanders use spies, scouts, and all forms of tactics to gather information.\n\nYet while spycraft was not unknown to the Romans it seems that they lagged far behind the capabilities of their peers across the Mediterranean. This becomes readily apparent over the course of the Punic Wars when they routinely get handed bloody defeats for intelligence failures. The Carthaginian general Hannibal Barca in particular put on a clinic during the Second Punic war that taught Rome a lesson in humility. Soon however the Italian power would learn to adapt to the tactics of its enemy and even adopt them. Its from the end of the Punic Wars on that we finally see Rome's intelligence operations finally begin to mature.\n\nThe rest of the documentary episode covers the emergence of the Speculatores units and what their role was in the Roman army. For more context, check out our other video on the Procursatores and Explroatores who worked closely with them as the eyes and ears of the Roman legions.\n\nWhat Units of History should we cover next?\n\nResearch: Chris Das Neves\nWriting: Chris Das Neves\nNarration: Guy Michaels\nArtwork: Penta Limited\n\nBibliography and Suggested Reading:\nRoman Warfare by Adrian Goldsworthy\nExploratio: Military & Political Intelligence in the Roman World from the Second Punic War to the Battle of Adrianople By N.

You\u2019ll also get 25% off if you want the full membership.\n\nIn this Units of History episode we take a look at the Speculatores, Spies of the Roman Army. We begin with a discussion of the early history of Rome and the misconception that these early armies of the Monarchy and Republic did not employ any form of covert operations or deception. This moralistic narrative often gets trotted out by ancient authors who want to elevate early Rome as some purer, more honorable society. However this strains credulity when you consider that Rome never would have survived let along risen to power without the use of intelligence operations. To prove this point we dive examples from their military history where commanders use spies, scouts, and all forms of tactics to gather information.\n\nYet while spycraft was not unknown to the Romans it seems that they lagged far behind the capabilities of their peers across the Mediterranean. This becomes readily apparent over the course of the Punic Wars when they routinely get handed bloody defeats for intelligence failures. The Carthaginian general Hannibal Barca in particular put on a clinic during the Second Punic war that taught Rome a lesson in humility. Soon however the Italian power would learn to adapt to the tactics of its enemy and even adopt them. Its from the end of the Punic Wars on that we finally see Rome's intelligence operations finally begin to mature.\n\nThe rest of the documentary episode covers the emergence of the Speculatores units and what their role was in the Roman army. For more context, check out our other video on the Procursatores and Explroatores who worked closely with them as the eyes and ears of the Roman legions.\n\nWhat Units of History should we cover next?\n\nResearch: Chris Das Neves\nWriting: Chris Das Neves\nNarration: Guy Michaels\nArtwork: Penta Limited\n\nBibliography and Suggested Reading:\nRoman Warfare by Adrian Goldsworthy\nExploratio: Military & Political Intelligence in the Roman World from the Second Punic War to the Battle of Adrianople By N.

Check out The Great Courses Plus to learn about daily life of Greek soldiers: http://ow.ly/osex30rvhjf\n\nIn this Units of History documentary we continue to explore the most famous ancient warriors from the past by turning to the kingdom of Macedon. We begin with the history of Macedon from the early Bronze Age as a small local power in the Balkans. According to legend its earliest kings had come from Argos and founded the Argead dynasty which was to rule Macedon for centuries. Initially this involved carving out a home in the lowland regions before slowly expanding the realm under great rulers like Amyntas 1.\n\nWhen the Persians arrived, Macedon initially became a vassal before being incorporated into the Achaemenid Empire following the Ionian Revolt. In the ensuing Greco Persian wars, Macedon fought with the Achaemenids such as at the battle of Platae but often helped both sides and ultimately turned on the easterners during their retreat. During the ensuing Peloponnesian War, the Kingdom of Macedon gained more power but was rocked by a series of assassinations, revolts, and invasions over the years which slowed its growth. It wasn't until the reign of Philip II that the Rise of Macedon would finally take place. This was made possible by the bold military reforms of Philip II which saw 600 Companion Cavalry take center stage of a new army. This force then subdued the surrounding regions of Greece, Thessaly, and Thrace making Macedon a formidable power that could now be turned against the Achaemenid Empire.\n\nWhen Philip II died, Alexander rose to the throne. After consolidating his realm, the young king them setoff to realize his father's dreams. 1800 Companion Cavalry would cross the Hellespont with the Macedonian Army. Their hammer and anvil strikes would prove to be one of the most effective tools in conquering the vast territories of the Achaemenid Empire. We cover the evolution of the Companions Cavalry and their fascinating service history over the course of the conquests of Alexander the Great. This includes their critical role in all major pitched battles: the Battle of the River Granicus, the Battle of Issus, the Battle of Gaugamela, and the Battle of Hydaspes. \n\nLet us know what units of history you want to see covered next!\n\n#UnitsOfHistory\n#Macedon\n#CompanionCavalry",

Check out our personal recommendation and MagellanTV\u2019s exclusive playlists: https://www.magellantv.com/explore/history\n\nIn this history documentary we explore one of the most famous units of Viking History, the berserkers. We begin by describing the main traits of a Viking berserker. The first is their animalistic qualities. This is actually tied to the broad trend of animal-human hybrids which appear in civilizations across the world. The Berserkers appear to have emerged from the norse version of this tradition with their sagas being filled with many instances of norse gods, legendary figures, and mortals transforming into all kinds of animals. The berserkers were just a subset of this group.\n\nOne of the next qualities of a Berserker was their rage, known as the berserkergang. This involved the viking warrior devolving into a rage filled state which might see them begin to bite their teeth and howl. The norse saga tradition has many tales of how this berserker rage led to much bloodletting of friend and foe. This leads us to the next quality of the berserker, their rejection by the community. This is a result of the way their violence threatened cultural taboos of loyalty and honor.\n\nWith this established we then talk about the viking weapons and armor which would have been used by the berserkers. Berserker armor is usually described as consisting of nothing but a shield however we speculate that they likely wore better gear, especially if they served in a noble's retinue. We then talk about training, initiation rights, and battle tactics. Finally we conclude by looking at their service history in viking warfare across the years.\n\nStay tuned for more content on the vikings and check out our videos on Assassin's Creed Valhalla where we will be exploring the world of ancient Scandinavia. Also keep an eye out for the portrayal of Berserkers in For Honor and other games to see if you can spot where legend and reality begin.\n\nBibliography and Suggested Reading:\n\"Edda\" by Snorri Sterlusson\n\u201cViking Warriors\u201d by Ben Hubbard\n\u201cThe psychology of the Berserkers: Going berserk\u201d by Owen Rees\n\u201cTransforming Warriors: The Ritual Organization of Military Force\u201d by Nordberg and Wallenstein\n\"On Going Berserk: A Neurochemical Inquiry\" by Howard D Fabing\n\u201cBerserk for berserkir: Introducing Combat Trauma to the Compendium of Theories on the Norse Berserker\u201d by Lily Geraty\n\n#Viking\n#History",

                        "description": "A military history documentary on the Berserkers who served as famous warriors in the Viking Army.

Check out our personal recommendation and MagellanTV\u2019s exclusive playlists: https://www.magellantv.com/explore/history\n\nIn this history documentary we explore one of the most famous units of Viking History, the berserkers. We begin by describing the main traits of a Viking berserker. The first is their animalistic qualities. This is actually tied to the broad trend of animal-human hybrids which appear in civilizations across the world. The Berserkers appear to have emerged from the norse version of this tradition with their sagas being filled with many instances of norse gods, legendary figures, and mortals transforming into all kinds of animals. The berserkers were just a subset of this group.\n\nOne of the next qualities of a Berserker was their rage, known as the berserkergang. This involved the viking warrior devolving into a rage filled state which might see them begin to bite their teeth and howl. The norse saga tradition has many tales of how this berserker rage led to much bloodletting of friend and foe. This leads us to the next quality of the berserker, their rejection by the community. This is a result of the way their violence threatened cultural taboos of loyalty and honor.\n\nWith this established we then talk about the viking weapons and armor which would have been used by the berserkers. Berserker armor is usually described as consisting of nothing but a shield however we speculate that they likely wore better gear, especially if they served in a noble's retinue. We then talk about training, initiation rights, and battle tactics. Finally we conclude by looking at their service history in viking warfare across the years.\n\nStay tuned for more content on the vikings and check out our videos on Assassin's Creed Valhalla where we will be exploring the world of ancient Scandinavia. Also keep an eye out for the portrayal of Berserkers in For Honor and other games to see if you can spot where legend and reality begin.\n\nBibliography and Suggested Reading:\n\"Edda\" by Snorri Sterlusson\n\u201cViking Warriors\u201d by Ben Hubbard\n\u201cThe psychology of the Berserkers: Going berserk\u201d by Owen Rees\n\u201cTransforming Warriors: The Ritual Organization of Military Force\u201d by Nordberg and Wallenstein\n\"On Going Berserk: A Neurochemical Inquiry\" by Howard D Fabing\n\u201cBerserk for berserkir: Introducing Combat Trauma to the Compendium of Theories on the Norse Berserker\u201d by Lily Geraty\n\n#Viking\n#History"

It's just $14,99 for one year!   https://curiositystream.com/SandRhoman\n\nThroughout the Middle Ages warfare in western Europe revolved around fortified places. Castles and walled towns controlled large parts of their surroundings. The garrisons, especially the cavalry, had a large operational range within which they could protect, enforce, attack, ravage, and forage. If an invading force was seriously looking for victory, these fortified centers of resistance needed to be dealt with first. Castles and walled towns, however, were designed not to be taken easily. So, as an attacker, how should you deal with them? While there are several ways to conquer a medieval fortress, in this video we will focus on sieges. Here is a nine-step guide on how to lay siege to a medieval Fortress.\n\nPatreon (thank you): https://www.patreon.com/sandrhomanhistory\nPaypal (thank you: https://www.paypal.com/paypalme/SandRhomanhistory\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/Sandrhoman\n\nChapters:\nIntro: 00:00-00:49\nStep 1: Be Quick 00:49-04:51\nStep 2: Hasty Assault 04:51-09:17\nStep 3: Secure Your Position 09:17-16:46\nStep 4: Wear Them Down 16:46-24:41\nStep 5: Negotiate 24:41-27:10\nStep 6: Advance 27:10-31:34\nStep 7: Breach 31:34-34:07\nStep 8: Let Them Hunger 34:07-37:34\nStep 9: Seize Your Price 37:34-40:36\n\nBibliography\nBarker, J., Conquest.

It's just $14,99 for one year!   https://curiositystream.com/SandRhoman\n\nThroughout the Middle Ages warfare in western Europe revolved around fortified places. Castles and walled towns controlled large parts of their surroundings. The garrisons, especially the cavalry, had a large operational range within which they could protect, enforce, attack, ravage, and forage. If an invading force was seriously looking for victory, these fortified centers of resistance needed to be dealt with first. Castles and walled towns, however, were designed not to be taken easily. So, as an attacker, how should you deal with them? While there are several ways to conquer a medieval fortress, in this video we will focus on sieges. Here is a nine-step guide on how to lay siege to a medieval Fortress.\n\nPatreon (thank you): https://www.patreon.com/sandrhomanhistory\nPaypal (thank you: https://www.paypal.com/paypalme/SandRhomanhistory\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/Sandrhoman\n\nChapters:\nIntro: 00:00-00:49\nStep 1: Be Quick 00:49-04:51\nStep 2: Hasty Assault 04:51-09:17\nStep 3: Secure Your Position 09:17-16:46\nStep 4: Wear Them Down 16:46-24:41\nStep 5: Negotiate 24:41-27:10\nStep 6: Advance 27:10-31:34\nStep 7: Breach 31:34-34:07\nStep 8: Let Them Hunger 34:07-37:34\nStep 9: Seize Your Price 37:34-40:36\n\nBibliography\nBarker, J., Conquest.

An invasion army of almost 100\u2019000 men, led by the experienced Lala Mustafa Pasha, had already taken the inland capital of Nicosia and by now had been camping outside Famagusta for more than eight months. The town was cut off completely and supplies began to run low, but the defenders put up a fierce fight, firing back at the Ottomans and meeting them in the trenches whenever possible. All the more, the Ot-tomans were determined to finish the job and bring the formidable fortress to its knees \u2013 and with it the whole of Cyprus.\n\nPatreon (thank you): https://www.patreon.com/sandrhomanhistory\nPrints & T-Shirts: https://sandrhoman.creator-spring.com/\nPaypal (thank you: https://www.paypal.com/paypalme/SandRhomanhistory\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/Sandrhoman\n\n#cyprus #documentary #siege \n\n00:00-00:53 Intro\n00:53-01:56 Nord VPN\n01:56-04:39 Chapter 1: Breach of Peace\n04:39-09:12 Chapter 2: Preparations\n09:12-13:09 Chapter 3: Disaster\n13:09-18:10 Chapter 4: Famagusta\n18:10-21:29 Chapter 5: Under Assault\n21:29-24:18 Chapter 6: Betrayal\n\nBibliography\nCaroline Finkel - Osman's Dream.

An invasion army of almost 100\u2019000 men, led by the experienced Lala Mustafa Pasha, had already taken the inland capital of Nicosia and by now had been camping outside Famagusta for more than eight months. The town was cut off completely and supplies began to run low, but the defenders put up a fierce fight, firing back at the Ottomans and meeting them in the trenches whenever possible. All the more, the Ot-tomans were determined to finish the job and bring the formidable fortress to its knees \u2013 and with it the whole of Cyprus.\n\nPatreon (thank you): https://www.patreon.com/sandrhomanhistory\nPrints & T-Shirts: https://sandrhoman.creator-spring.com/\nPaypal (thank you: https://www.paypal.com/paypalme/SandRhomanhistory\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/Sandrhoman\n\n#cyprus #documentary #siege \n\n00:00-00:53 Intro\n00:53-01:56 Nord VPN\n01:56-04:39 Chapter 1: Breach of Peace\n04:39-09:12 Chapter 2: Preparations\n09:12-13:09 Chapter 3: Disaster\n13:09-18:10 Chapter 4: Famagusta\n18:10-21:29 Chapter 5: Under Assault\n21:29-24:18 Chapter 6: Betrayal\n\nBibliography\nCaroline Finkel - Osman's Dream.

Their arrival marked the beginning of a siege characterized by subterranean warfare, nasty weather, and serious supply problems. The siege of Vienna was rather short, but it was without doubt an event of pan-European importance. It ended the perceived invincibility that had surrounded the Ottoman army just when it had come closer to central Europe than ever before. For centuries this event had extraordinary symbolic power, but it is now overshadowed by the second Ottoman siege in 1683. In this video we present the story of the first Ottoman siege of Vienna which was no less staggering than the second one.\n\nPatreon (thank you): https://www.patreon.com/sandrhomanhistory\nPaypal (thank you): https://www.paypal.com/paypalme/SandRhomanhistory\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/Sandrhoman\n\nBibliography:\nBremm K.-J., Die T\u00fcrken vor Wien.

Their arrival marked the beginning of a siege characterized by subterranean warfare, nasty weather, and serious supply problems. The siege of Vienna was rather short, but it was without doubt an event of pan-European importance. It ended the perceived invincibility that had surrounded the Ottoman army just when it had come closer to central Europe than ever before. For centuries this event had extraordinary symbolic power, but it is now overshadowed by the second Ottoman siege in 1683. In this video we present the story of the first Ottoman siege of Vienna which was no less staggering than the second one.\n\nPatreon (thank you): https://www.patreon.com/sandrhomanhistory\nPaypal (thank you): https://www.paypal.com/paypalme/SandRhomanhistory\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/Sandrhoman\n\nBibliography:\nBremm K.-J., Die T\u00fcrken vor Wien.

Their arrival marked the beginning of a siege characterized by subterranean warfare, delays on both sides, and an \u201capocalyptic storm\u201d of Tatar riders ravaging the hinterland. The siege was eventually ended by the battle of Vienna, when the Polish winged Hussars arrived under King Jan III Sobieski famously charged into the Ottoman army. The siege and battle of Vienna are discussed extensively by historians up to this day.

                        "description": "The second (Staggering) Siege of Vienna 1683:\nOn the 14th July 1683, an Ottoman army under the command of the Grand Vizier Kara Mustafa Pasha arrived at the Gates of Vienna. Their arrival marked the beginning of a siege characterized by subterranean warfare, delays on both sides, and an \u201capocalyptic storm\u201d of Tatar riders ravaging the hinterland. The siege was eventually ended by the battle of Vienna, when the Polish winged Hussars arrived under King Jan III Sobieski famously charged into the Ottoman army. The siege and battle of Vienna are discussed extensively by historians up to this day. It is considered the turning point in the westward expansion of the Ottomans and it is an interesting case study for any student of warfare.

The fate of this conflict was decided by the battle of Nisibis in 217 AD.\n\nSupport us on Patreon: http://www.patreon.com/KingsandGenerals or Paypal: http://paypal.me/kingsandgenerals\n\nWe are grateful to our patrons and sponsors, who made this video possible: https://drive.google.com/open?id=1JlqSD0nyP64psCnaLrwFT3zVTZiordU1jnwXeZOu1to\n\nThe video, alongside Machinima for it was created by Malay Archer http://bit.ly/2HjS2zP while the script video was written by Matt Hollis.\n\nThis video was narrated by Officially Devin (https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCU0-VII-V376zFxiRGMeZGg & https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC79s7EdN9uXX77-Ly2HmEjQ)\n\nMachinimas were made on Total War: Rome 2 engine (https://www.youtube.com/user/MathemedicUpdates)\n\n\u2714 Merch store \u25ba https://teespring.com/stores/kingsandgenerals\n\u2714 Patreon \u25ba https://www.patreon.com/KingsandGenerals\n\u2714 Podcast \u25ba https://kingsandgenerals.libsyn.com/ iTunes: https://apple.co/2QTuMNG\n\u2714 PayPal \u25ba http://paypal.me/kingsandgenerals\n\u2714 Twitter \u25ba https://twitter.com/KingsGenerals\n\u2714 Facebook \u25ba https://www.facebook.com/KingsGenerals\n\u2714 Instagram \u25bahttp://www.instagram.com/Kings_Generals\n\nProduction Music courtesy of Epidemic Sound: http://www.epidemicsound.com\n\n#Documentary #Parthia #Rome"

The battle of the Milvian Bridge of 312 AD was crucial, as it allowed Constantine the Great to take over part of the Empire and make Christianity the official religion of the realm.\n\nSupport us on Patreon: http://www.patreon.com/KingsandGenerals or Paypal: http://paypal.me/kingsandgenerals\n\nCheck out our Merch Store: https://teespring.com/stores/kingsandgenerals\n\nWe are grateful to our patrons and youtube members, who made this video possible: https://drive.google.com/open?id=11MXWSLuQtsx-FKtzhjqzLIPL9DW6vvhztwC81PF8ya8\n\nThe script for this video was researched and written by Matt Hollis\n\nThis video was narrated by Officially Devin (https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCU0-VII-V376zFxiRGMeZGg & https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC79s7EdN9uXX77-Ly2HmEjQ)\n\nMachinimas for the video made on the Total War: Attila Engine by  Malay Archer (https://www.youtube.com/user/MathemedicUpdates)\n\n\u2714 Merch store \u25ba https://teespring.com/stores/kingsandgenerals\n\u2714 Patreon \u25ba https://www.patreon.com/KingsandGenerals\n\u2714 Podcast \u25ba https://kingsandgenerals.libsyn.com/ iTunes: https://apple.co/2QTuMNG\n\u2714 PayPal \u25ba http://paypal.me/kingsandgenerals\n\u2714 Twitter \u25ba https://twitter.com/KingsGenerals\n\u2714 Facebook \u25ba https://www.facebook.com/KingsGenerals\n\u2714 Instagram \u25bahttp://www.instagram.com/Kings_Generals\n\nStephen Mitchell - A History of the Later Roman Empire: AD 284-641\nBill Leadbeater - Galerius and the Will of Diocletian\nRoss Cowan - Milvian Bridge AD 312: Constantine's battle for Empire and Faith\n\nProduction Music courtesy of Epidemic Sound: http://www.epidemicsound.com\n\n#Documentary #MilvianBridge #RomanEmpire"
