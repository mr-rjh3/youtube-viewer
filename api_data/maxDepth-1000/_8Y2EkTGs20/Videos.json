Let's see who's in the house!\n\nLive Stream Guidelines (currently a work in progress!) -\n\nTo ensure the smooth running of the streams and to maintain the sense of community we have, I have a few guidelines to set out. I think it\u2019s mostly just common sense, but just for the record - \n\n- No profanity or offensive language (or hate speech, name calling etc.)\n- No self promotion for your business, products etc.\n- Keep things light! (A lot of people like to \u2018escape\u2019 for the duration of the live stream, from problems, illnesses, just depressing facts of life, so I always aim to make the chat room a positive place to be!)\n- On the previous note, please avoid talking about religion or politics, as these topics can get heavy!\n\nModerating (IMPORTANT!)\n\nThe Live Streams are moderated by people not associated with the channel. They have no affiliation, will not comment or engage in any conversations and will be moderating to the guidelines set out above. If the guidelines are not followed, they will take action. As they are solely moderating the streams, logs will be kept of any incidents that occur including any actions taken. \n\nIf you have had any actions taken against you and would like clarification as to the reason why, head to www.wingsofpegasus.com and go to the 'contact' page, fill out the form, and I\u2019ll reply with the explanation. The reason will be in the guidelines, so make sure you read them carefully! \n\nWith that said, have fun in the stream and I\u2019ll see you there! \n\nFil.\n\nFor more, check out my other sites! \n\nhttps://www.patreon.com/wingsofpegasus\nhttps://www.wingsofpegasusband.com/\nhttps://www.facebook.com/wingsofpegasus\nTwitter - @wingsofpegasus\nInsta - @wingsofpegasusofficial",

Let's see who's in the house!\n\nLive Stream Guidelines (currently a work in progress!) -\n\nTo ensure the smooth running of the streams and to maintain the sense of community we have, I have a few guidelines to set out. I think it\u2019s mostly just common sense, but just for the record - \n\n- No profanity or offensive language (or hate speech, name calling etc.)\n- No self promotion for your business, products etc.\n- Keep things light! (A lot of people like to \u2018escape\u2019 for the duration of the live stream, from problems, illnesses, just depressing facts of life, so I always aim to make the chat room a positive place to be!)\n- On the previous note, please avoid talking about religion or politics, as these topics can get heavy!\n\nModerating (IMPORTANT!)\n\nThe Live Streams are moderated by people not associated with the channel. They have no affiliation, will not comment or engage in any conversations and will be moderating to the guidelines set out above. If the guidelines are not followed, they will take action. As they are solely moderating the streams, logs will be kept of any incidents that occur including any actions taken. \n\nIf you have had any actions taken against you and would like clarification as to the reason why, head to www.wingsofpegasus.com and go to the 'contact' page, fill out the form, and I\u2019ll reply with the explanation. The reason will be in the guidelines, so make sure you read them carefully! \n\nWith that said, have fun in the stream and I\u2019ll see you there! \n\nFil.\n\nFor more, check out my other sites! \n\nhttps://www.patreon.com/wingsofpegasus\nhttps://www.wingsofpegasusband.com/\nhttps://www.facebook.com/wingsofpegasus\nTwitter - @wingsofpegasus\nInsta - @wingsofpegasusofficial"

Also click the join buttion below for exclusive perks.\nIt\u2019s July 30th 1943 in the skies over Germany and a B-17 named Tondelayo is under attack. In the back is tailgunner Michael L Arooth. Mike as he is known to the crew is ready as the German Me 109s and FW190s come in.. Sometimes 4 at a time. Mike fires away at the mass of German fighters as do the rest of the formation as today there are 186 Flying fortresses and 123 P-47 Thunderbolts in a raid upon German factories.\nGetting hit by heavy fire, many of the crew bail. Mike fought on battling the Germans and lack of oxygen. In the end though the plane would have been brought down if it weren\u2019t for the actions of an unknown munitions worker who was forced to work for the Germans.\n\nYarnhub uses the Unreal\u00ae Engine.

Also click the join buttion below for exclusive perks.\nIt\u2019s July 30th 1943 in the skies over Germany and a B-17 named Tondelayo is under attack. In the back is tailgunner Michael L Arooth. Mike as he is known to the crew is ready as the German Me 109s and FW190s come in.. Sometimes 4 at a time. Mike fires away at the mass of German fighters as do the rest of the formation as today there are 186 Flying fortresses and 123 P-47 Thunderbolts in a raid upon German factories.\nGetting hit by heavy fire, many of the crew bail. Mike fought on battling the Germans and lack of oxygen. In the end though the plane would have been brought down if it weren\u2019t for the actions of an unknown munitions worker who was forced to work for the Germans.\n\nYarnhub uses the Unreal\u00ae Engine.

The 100th Bomb Group led by Major John Eagan took off and assembled into formation. The last plane in the formation was the most vulnerable and known as \"tail-end Charlie\". On this mission that misfortune fell to a plane called the Royal Flush.  It was piloted by young officer Lieutenant Robert Rosenthal.  13 planes took off and only one would return.  How could the most vulnerable of the planes in the worst position make it's way home on that day?\n\nHit join to become a member and get exclusive perks  https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC-f2WBfSCZiu0bOBydjot3w/join  \nSupport us on Patreon https://patreon.com/yarnhub\nCheck out our exclusive merch https://yarnhubstore.com \nJoin us on Discord https://discord.gg/yarnhub\n\n00:00 100th plan to hit Munster\n02:35 Where are the fighters?\n03:25 Enemies arrive\n04:19 M\u2019lle Zig Zag is hit\n07:10 Finish off the B-17 lead\n07:40 Bail out\n09:17 Royal Flush gets bombs away\n10:15 German planes attack the last B-17\n11:28 6 new German Fighters\n13:48 Royal Flush returns to base\n14:53 The 'Bloody' 100th bomb group \n\nYarnhub uses the Unreal\u00ae Engine.

The 100th Bomb Group led by Major John Eagan took off and assembled into formation. The last plane in the formation was the most vulnerable and known as \"tail-end Charlie\". On this mission that misfortune fell to a plane called the Royal Flush.  It was piloted by young officer Lieutenant Robert Rosenthal.  13 planes took off and only one would return.  How could the most vulnerable of the planes in the worst position make it's way home on that day?\n\nHit join to become a member and get exclusive perks  https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC-f2WBfSCZiu0bOBydjot3w/join  \nSupport us on Patreon https://patreon.com/yarnhub\nCheck out our exclusive merch https://yarnhubstore.com \nJoin us on Discord https://discord.gg/yarnhub\n\n00:00 100th plan to hit Munster\n02:35 Where are the fighters?\n03:25 Enemies arrive\n04:19 M\u2019lle Zig Zag is hit\n07:10 Finish off the B-17 lead\n07:40 Bail out\n09:17 Royal Flush gets bombs away\n10:15 German planes attack the last B-17\n11:28 6 new German Fighters\n13:48 Royal Flush returns to base\n14:53 The 'Bloody' 100th bomb group \n\nYarnhub uses the Unreal\u00ae Engine.

With his bright Red Fokker triplane he's a character that fires the imagination.   He takes us to a time of knights in the air, locked in mortal combat.  Turning and diving and climbing.  Higher !  He's so legendary we had to make a film in honor of him twice.  We hope you like the improvement.\n\nYarnhub uses the Unreal\u00ae Engine.

Mainly attributed to the ghost of the pilot Lieutenant Desmond Arthur ,he and his plane have been seen by many.  \nThe hauntings became so prevalent that by  1949 any newcomers to the Montrose airbase were given a printed document as part of their familiarization with the base informing the staff that the camp was haunted by the youngest ghost in the Royal Airforce, an officer named Flight Lieutenant Arthur.\nThe Hauntings continue to this day.....\n\nSources:The Scotsman Newspaper, Ghosts of the Air by Martin Caidin and Wikipedia\n\nYarnhub uses the Unreal\u00ae Engine.

All of these apparitions and more have been an almost constant feature of Montrose Airbase.  Mainly attributed to the ghost of the pilot Lieutenant Desmond Arthur ,he and his plane have been seen by many.  \nThe hauntings became so prevalent that by  1949 any newcomers to the Montrose airbase were given a printed document as part of their familiarization with the base informing the staff that the camp was haunted by the youngest ghost in the Royal Airforce, an officer named Flight Lieutenant Arthur.\nThe Hauntings continue to this day.....\n\nSources:The Scotsman Newspaper, Ghosts of the Air by Martin Caidin and Wikipedia\n\nYarnhub uses the Unreal\u00ae Engine.

Taffy 3 were under-gunned and under-armored for such a battle and as such this became one of the greatest last stands in Naval history. The force of the Imperial Japanese Navy was made out of 11 destroyers, 2 light cruisers, 6 heavy cruisers, 3 Battleships, and in the middle of them all was the biggest warship to ever grace the seas, the pride of the Imperial Navy, the Yamato. The Yamato alone was larger than all of the ships from Taffy 3 combined. In the words of Lieutenant Commander Robert Witcher Copeland \u201cThis will be a fight against overwhelming odds from which survival cannot be expected. We  will do what damage we can.\"\n\nYarnhub uses the Unreal\u00ae Engine. Unreal\u00ae is a trademark or registered trademark of Epic Games, Inc. in the United States of America and elsewhere.

Taffy 3 were under-gunned and under-armored for such a battle and as such this became one of the greatest last stands in Naval history. The force of the Imperial Japanese Navy was made out of 11 destroyers, 2 light cruisers, 6 heavy cruisers, 3 Battleships, and in the middle of them all was the biggest warship to ever grace the seas, the pride of the Imperial Navy, the Yamato. The Yamato alone was larger than all of the ships from Taffy 3 combined. In the words of Lieutenant Commander Robert Witcher Copeland \u201cThis will be a fight against overwhelming odds from which survival cannot be expected. We  will do what damage we can.\"\n\nYarnhub uses the Unreal\u00ae Engine. Unreal\u00ae is a trademark or registered trademark of Epic Games, Inc. in the United States of America and elsewhere.

With her twins in college, this empty-nester is left trying to mend her fractured friendships. \n\nAlways on the move, Heather Dubrow and husband Terry find themselves routinely commuting between Orange County and their new estate in Beverly Hills. After many years of friendship, Heather and Gina find themselves at odds over loyalty and betrayal. \n\nNo longer a Tres Amiga, Tamra Judge is putting her energy into developing stronger friendships and helping her daughter Sophia, who recently turned 18, navigate her gap year. Tamra\u2019s damaged friendship with Shannon is hotly contested as she wonders if Shannon is truly remorseful for her accident. \n\nGina Kirschenheiter has leveled up as a realtor, but her professional reputation is called into question after one of the ladies puts her in a sticky situation. Her relationship with Travis takes an unconventional turn when deciding she wants to live separately, but stay together. On top of this, as Gina watches bestie Emily get close to Tamra, she wonders if their friendship will remain the same. \n\nEmily Simpson has gone through an incredible transformation after losing 40 pounds and finds herself trying to adjust to her new healthy lifestyle. When she\u2019s not helping the wrongly convicted as a part of the California Innocence Project, she\u2019s questioning the ladies on everything from integrity to intentions. \n\nJennifer Pedranti is ready for a fresh start with Tamra while also trying to prove that her boyfriend, Ryan, is worthy of redemption. While some of the ladies in the group wonder if she has truly learned from her past mistakes, Jennifer finds some commonality with new housewife Katie. New to Orange County, Katie Ginella and her husband, professional golf journalist Matt Ginella, recently moved from San Diego. \n\nNow ready to learn more about her Korean heritage and connect to her roots, Katie decides to explore her adoption further and meet her birth mother. A longtime friend of Heather and Emily, Alexis Bellino comes in full force ready to make waves. She finds her footing with most of the ladies and starts fresh with Tamra, but she instantly finds herself on shaky ground with Shannon as they face off in a series of high-stakes disputes. \n\nCast:\nShannon Storms Beador\nHeather Dubrow\nTamra Judge\nGina Kirschenheiter\nEmily Simpson\nJennifer Pedranti\nKatie Ginella\n\nAbout Bravo:   \nBravo is the premier lifestyle and entertainment brand that drives cultural conversation around its high-quality, interactive original content across all platforms.

Tamra comes in hot and her reconciliation with Shannon does not go as planned. Tamra is holding everyone accountable, especially her friend Jennifer, but when the narrative doesn\u2019t add up, it leads to some explosive confrontations. Shannon Storms Beador is trying to keep the positive energy around as she looks to mend her fractured friendship and rebuild trust with her former bestie Tamra. Once Tamra and Shannon clear the air, it makes way for the Tres Amigas to reunite as the OG of the OC Vicki Gunvalson joins the fun for tequila and keg stands. With her twins off to college on opposite coasts, Heather Dubrow embraces a new chapter of her life.  Heather is determined to dive back into her acting career and launch a new business venture, but she questions whether she can accomplish it all. With the ladies, Heather lands herself in the middle of Tamra and Shannon\u2019s feud, but when they finally reconcile, she wonders where she fits in between their friendship. Gina Kirschenheiter and Travis join forces in real estate, hoping to be a dynamic duo, but first she has to pass the exam and get her license. She is informed that her style of friendship is not up to Heather\u2019s standards, but as Gina works to prove her loyalty, she feels continually shut down. With her husband Shane working as a full-time lawyer, Emily Simpson fulfills her dreams of being a stay-at-home mom as she supports Annabelle\u2019s modeling aspirations, while continuing to help the wrongly convicted as part of the California Innocence Project. In a turn of events, Emily reconnects with Tamra, as the two develop a close friendship after working through their tumultuous past. Brought into the group through Tamra, new Housewife and yoga studio owner Jennifer Pedranti is a mother of five with children ranging from 5 to 18.  A strong advocate for fostering children and animals, she recently adopted her youngest child Dominic. She is currently navigating her recent split from her husband, Will, who runs her family business, as they share a home. Her friendship with Tamra is put to the test, as she is forced to explain cheating rumors and confront difficult truths. Taylor Armstrong moved to Orange County nearly ten years ago and is brought into the circle after becoming fast friends with Tamra. As Taylor pursues an acting career and is offered her first movie role, she seeks coaching and advice from Heather. \n\nCast:\nTamra Judge\nShannon Storms Beador\nHeather Dubrow\nGina Kirschenheiter\nEmily Simpson\nJennifer Pedranti\nTaylor Armstrong\n\nAbout Bravo:   \nBravo is the premier lifestyle and entertainment brand that drives cultural conversation around its high-quality, interactive original content across all platforms.

Tamra comes in hot and her reconciliation with Shannon does not go as planned. Tamra is holding everyone accountable, especially her friend Jennifer, but when the narrative doesn\u2019t add up, it leads to some explosive confrontations. Shannon Storms Beador is trying to keep the positive energy around as she looks to mend her fractured friendship and rebuild trust with her former bestie Tamra. Once Tamra and Shannon clear the air, it makes way for the Tres Amigas to reunite as the OG of the OC Vicki Gunvalson joins the fun for tequila and keg stands. With her twins off to college on opposite coasts, Heather Dubrow embraces a new chapter of her life.  Heather is determined to dive back into her acting career and launch a new business venture, but she questions whether she can accomplish it all. With the ladies, Heather lands herself in the middle of Tamra and Shannon\u2019s feud, but when they finally reconcile, she wonders where she fits in between their friendship. Gina Kirschenheiter and Travis join forces in real estate, hoping to be a dynamic duo, but first she has to pass the exam and get her license. She is informed that her style of friendship is not up to Heather\u2019s standards, but as Gina works to prove her loyalty, she feels continually shut down. With her husband Shane working as a full-time lawyer, Emily Simpson fulfills her dreams of being a stay-at-home mom as she supports Annabelle\u2019s modeling aspirations, while continuing to help the wrongly convicted as part of the California Innocence Project. In a turn of events, Emily reconnects with Tamra, as the two develop a close friendship after working through their tumultuous past. Brought into the group through Tamra, new Housewife and yoga studio owner Jennifer Pedranti is a mother of five with children ranging from 5 to 18.  A strong advocate for fostering children and animals, she recently adopted her youngest child Dominic. She is currently navigating her recent split from her husband, Will, who runs her family business, as they share a home. Her friendship with Tamra is put to the test, as she is forced to explain cheating rumors and confront difficult truths. Taylor Armstrong moved to Orange County nearly ten years ago and is brought into the circle after becoming fast friends with Tamra. As Taylor pursues an acting career and is offered her first movie role, she seeks coaching and advice from Heather. \n\nCast:\nTamra Judge\nShannon Storms Beador\nHeather Dubrow\nGina Kirschenheiter\nEmily Simpson\nJennifer Pedranti\nTaylor Armstrong\n\nAbout Bravo:   \nBravo is the premier lifestyle and entertainment brand that drives cultural conversation around its high-quality, interactive original content across all platforms.

Tamra comes in hot and her reconciliation with Shannon does not go as planned. Tamra is holding everyone accountable, especially her friend Jennifer, but when the narrative doesn\u2019t add up, it leads to some explosive confrontations. Shannon Storms Beador is trying to keep the positive energy around as she looks to mend her fractured friendship and rebuild trust with her former bestie Tamra. Once Tamra and Shannon clear the air, it makes way for the Tres Amigas to reunite as the OG of the OC Vicki Gunvalson joins the fun for tequila and keg stands. With her twins off to college on opposite coasts, Heather Dubrow embraces a new chapter of her life.  Heather is determined to dive back into her acting career and launch a new business venture, but she questions whether she can accomplish it all. With the ladies, Heather lands herself in the middle of Tamra and Shannon\u2019s feud, but when they finally reconcile, she wonders where she fits in between their friendship. Gina Kirschenheiter and Travis join forces in real estate, hoping to be a dynamic duo, but first she has to pass the exam and get her license. She is informed that her style of friendship is not up to Heather\u2019s standards, but as Gina works to prove her loyalty, she feels continually shut down. With her husband Shane working as a full-time lawyer, Emily Simpson fulfills her dreams of being a stay-at-home mom as she supports Annabelle\u2019s modeling aspirations, while continuing to help the wrongly convicted as part of the California Innocence Project. In a turn of events, Emily reconnects with Tamra, as the two develop a close friendship after working through their tumultuous past. Brought into the group through Tamra, new Housewife and yoga studio owner Jennifer Pedranti is a mother of five with children ranging from 5 to 18.  A strong advocate for fostering children and animals, she recently adopted her youngest child Dominic. She is currently navigating her recent split from her husband, Will, who runs her family business, as they share a home. Her friendship with Tamra is put to the test, as she is forced to explain cheating rumors and confront difficult truths. Taylor Armstrong moved to Orange County nearly ten years ago and is brought into the circle after becoming fast friends with Tamra. As Taylor pursues an acting career and is offered her first movie role, she seeks coaching and advice from Heather. \n\nCast:\nTamra Judge\nShannon Storms Beador\nHeather Dubrow\nGina Kirschenheiter\nEmily Simpson\nJennifer Pedranti\nTaylor Armstrong\n\nAbout Bravo:   \nBravo is the premier lifestyle and entertainment brand that drives cultural conversation around its high-quality, interactive original content across all platforms.

Tamra comes in hot and her reconciliation with Shannon does not go as planned. Tamra is holding everyone accountable, especially her friend Jennifer, but when the narrative doesn\u2019t add up, it leads to some explosive confrontations. Shannon Storms Beador is trying to keep the positive energy around as she looks to mend her fractured friendship and rebuild trust with her former bestie Tamra.

Tamra comes in hot and her reconciliation with Shannon does not go as planned. Tamra is holding everyone accountable, especially her friend Jennifer, but when the narrative doesn\u2019t add up, it leads to some explosive confrontations. Shannon Storms Beador is trying to keep the positive energy around as she looks to mend her fractured friendship and rebuild trust with her former bestie Tamra. Once Tamra and Shannon clear the air, it makes way for the Tres Amigas to reunite as the OG of the OC Vicki Gunvalson joins the fun for tequila and keg stands. With her twins off to college on opposite coasts, Heather Dubrow embraces a new chapter of her life.  Heather is determined to dive back into her acting career and launch a new business venture, but she questions whether she can accomplish it all. With the ladies, Heather lands herself in the middle of Tamra and Shannon\u2019s feud, but when they finally reconcile, she wonders where she fits in between their friendship. Gina Kirschenheiter and Travis join forces in real estate, hoping to be a dynamic duo, but first she has to pass the exam and get her license. She is informed that her style of friendship is not up to Heather\u2019s standards, but as Gina works to prove her loyalty, she feels continually shut down. With her husband Shane working as a full-time lawyer, Emily Simpson fulfills her dreams of being a stay-at-home mom as she supports Annabelle\u2019s modeling aspirations, while continuing to help the wrongly convicted as part of the California Innocence Project. In a turn of events, Emily reconnects with Tamra, as the two develop a close friendship after working through their tumultuous past. Brought into the group through Tamra, new Housewife and yoga studio owner Jennifer Pedranti is a mother of five with children ranging from 5 to 18.  A strong advocate for fostering children and animals, she recently adopted her youngest child Dominic. She is currently navigating her recent split from her husband, Will, who runs her family business, as they share a home. Her friendship with Tamra is put to the test, as she is forced to explain cheating rumors and confront difficult truths. Taylor Armstrong moved to Orange County nearly ten years ago and is brought into the circle after becoming fast friends with Tamra. As Taylor pursues an acting career and is offered her first movie role, she seeks coaching and advice from Heather. \n\nCast:\nTamra Judge\nShannon Storms Beador\nHeather Dubrow\nGina Kirschenheiter\nEmily Simpson\nJennifer Pedranti\nTaylor Armstrong\n\nAbout Bravo:   \nBravo is the premier lifestyle and entertainment brand that drives cultural conversation around its high-quality, interactive original content across all platforms.

Tamra comes in hot and her reconciliation with Shannon does not go as planned. Tamra is holding everyone accountable, especially her friend Jennifer, but when the narrative doesn\u2019t add up, it leads to some explosive confrontations. Shannon Storms Beador is trying to keep the positive energy around as she looks to mend her fractured friendship and rebuild trust with her former bestie Tamra. Once Tamra and Shannon clear the air, it makes way for the Tres Amigas to reunite as the OG of the OC Vicki Gunvalson joins the fun for tequila and keg stands. With her twins off to college on opposite coasts, Heather Dubrow embraces a new chapter of her life.  Heather is determined to dive back into her acting career and launch a new business venture, but she questions whether she can accomplish it all. With the ladies, Heather lands herself in the middle of Tamra and Shannon\u2019s feud, but when they finally reconcile, she wonders where she fits in between their friendship. Gina Kirschenheiter and Travis join forces in real estate, hoping to be a dynamic duo, but first she has to pass the exam and get her license. She is informed that her style of friendship is not up to Heather\u2019s standards, but as Gina works to prove her loyalty, she feels continually shut down. With her husband Shane working as a full-time lawyer, Emily Simpson fulfills her dreams of being a stay-at-home mom as she supports Annabelle\u2019s modeling aspirations, while continuing to help the wrongly convicted as part of the California Innocence Project. In a turn of events, Emily reconnects with Tamra, as the two develop a close friendship after working through their tumultuous past. Brought into the group through Tamra, new Housewife and yoga studio owner Jennifer Pedranti is a mother of five with children ranging from 5 to 18.  A strong advocate for fostering children and animals, she recently adopted her youngest child Dominic. She is currently navigating her recent split from her husband, Will, who runs her family business, as they share a home. Her friendship with Tamra is put to the test, as she is forced to explain cheating rumors and confront difficult truths. Taylor Armstrong moved to Orange County nearly ten years ago and is brought into the circle after becoming fast friends with Tamra. As Taylor pursues an acting career and is offered her first movie role, she seeks coaching and advice from Heather. \n\nCast:\nTamra Judge\nShannon Storms Beador\nHeather Dubrow\nGina Kirschenheiter\nEmily Simpson\nJennifer Pedranti\nTaylor Armstrong\n\nAbout Bravo:   \nBravo is the premier lifestyle and entertainment brand that drives cultural conversation around its high-quality, interactive original content across all platforms.

Tamra comes in hot and her reconciliation with Shannon does not go as planned. Tamra is holding everyone accountable, especially her friend Jennifer, but when the narrative doesn\u2019t add up, it leads to some explosive confrontations. Shannon Storms Beador is trying to keep the positive energy around as she looks to mend her fractured friendship and rebuild trust with her former bestie Tamra. Once Tamra and Shannon clear the air, it makes way for the Tres Amigas to reunite as the OG of the OC Vicki Gunvalson joins the fun for tequila and keg stands. With her twins off to college on opposite coasts, Heather Dubrow embraces a new chapter of her life.  Heather is determined to dive back into her acting career and launch a new business venture, but she questions whether she can accomplish it all. With the ladies, Heather lands herself in the middle of Tamra and Shannon\u2019s feud, but when they finally reconcile, she wonders where she fits in between their friendship. Gina Kirschenheiter and Travis join forces in real estate, hoping to be a dynamic duo, but first she has to pass the exam and get her license. She is informed that her style of friendship is not up to Heather\u2019s standards, but as Gina works to prove her loyalty, she feels continually shut down. With her husband Shane working as a full-time lawyer, Emily Simpson fulfills her dreams of being a stay-at-home mom as she supports Annabelle\u2019s modeling aspirations, while continuing to help the wrongly convicted as part of the California Innocence Project. In a turn of events, Emily reconnects with Tamra, as the two develop a close friendship after working through their tumultuous past. Brought into the group through Tamra, new Housewife and yoga studio owner Jennifer Pedranti is a mother of five with children ranging from 5 to 18.  A strong advocate for fostering children and animals, she recently adopted her youngest child Dominic. She is currently navigating her recent split from her husband, Will, who runs her family business, as they share a home. Her friendship with Tamra is put to the test, as she is forced to explain cheating rumors and confront difficult truths. Taylor Armstrong moved to Orange County nearly ten years ago and is brought into the circle after becoming fast friends with Tamra. As Taylor pursues an acting career and is offered her first movie role, she seeks coaching and advice from Heather. \n\nCast:\nTamra Judge\nShannon Storms Beador\nHeather Dubrow\nGina Kirschenheiter\nEmily Simpson\nJennifer Pedranti\nTaylor Armstrong\n\nAbout Bravo:   \nBravo is the premier lifestyle and entertainment brand that drives cultural conversation around its high-quality, interactive original content across all platforms.

Tamra comes in hot and her reconciliation with Shannon does not go as planned. Tamra is holding everyone accountable, especially her friend Jennifer, but when the narrative doesn\u2019t add up, it leads to some explosive confrontations. Shannon Storms Beador is trying to keep the positive energy around as she looks to mend her fractured friendship and rebuild trust with her former bestie Tamra. Once Tamra and Shannon clear the air, it makes way for the Tres Amigas to reunite as the OG of the OC Vicki Gunvalson joins the fun for tequila and keg stands. With her twins off to college on opposite coasts, Heather Dubrow embraces a new chapter of her life.  Heather is determined to dive back into her acting career and launch a new business venture, but she questions whether she can accomplish it all. With the ladies, Heather lands herself in the middle of Tamra and Shannon\u2019s feud, but when they finally reconcile, she wonders where she fits in between their friendship. Gina Kirschenheiter and Travis join forces in real estate, hoping to be a dynamic duo, but first she has to pass the exam and get her license. She is informed that her style of friendship is not up to Heather\u2019s standards, but as Gina works to prove her loyalty, she feels continually shut down. With her husband Shane working as a full-time lawyer, Emily Simpson fulfills her dreams of being a stay-at-home mom as she supports Annabelle\u2019s modeling aspirations, while continuing to help the wrongly convicted as part of the California Innocence Project. In a turn of events, Emily reconnects with Tamra, as the two develop a close friendship after working through their tumultuous past. Brought into the group through Tamra, new Housewife and yoga studio owner Jennifer Pedranti is a mother of five with children ranging from 5 to 18.  A strong advocate for fostering children and animals, she recently adopted her youngest child Dominic. She is currently navigating her recent split from her husband, Will, who runs her family business, as they share a home. Her friendship with Tamra is put to the test, as she is forced to explain cheating rumors and confront difficult truths. Taylor Armstrong moved to Orange County nearly ten years ago and is brought into the circle after becoming fast friends with Tamra. As Taylor pursues an acting career and is offered her first movie role, she seeks coaching and advice from Heather. \n\nCast:\nTamra Judge\nShannon Storms Beador\nHeather Dubrow\nGina Kirschenheiter\nEmily Simpson\nJennifer Pedranti\nTaylor Armstrong\n\nAbout Bravo:   \nBravo is the premier lifestyle and entertainment brand that drives cultural conversation around its high-quality, interactive original content across all platforms.

Elsewhere, Tamra Judge finds out she made things worse with Shannon Storms Beador at the boat party. The Real Housewives of Orange County Season 17 Episode 3.

Tamra comes in hot and her reconciliation with Shannon does not go as planned. Tamra is holding everyone accountable, especially her friend Jennifer, but when the narrative doesn\u2019t add up, it leads to some explosive confrontations. Shannon Storms Beador is trying to keep the positive energy around as she looks to mend her fractured friendship and rebuild trust with her former bestie Tamra. Once Tamra and Shannon clear the air, it makes way for the Tres Amigas to reunite as the OG of the OC Vicki Gunvalson joins the fun for tequila and keg stands. With her twins off to college on opposite coasts, Heather Dubrow embraces a new chapter of her life.  Heather is determined to dive back into her acting career and launch a new business venture, but she questions whether she can accomplish it all. With the ladies, Heather lands herself in the middle of Tamra and Shannon\u2019s feud, but when they finally reconcile, she wonders where she fits in between their friendship. Gina Kirschenheiter and Travis join forces in real estate, hoping to be a dynamic duo, but first she has to pass the exam and get her license. She is informed that her style of friendship is not up to Heather\u2019s standards, but as Gina works to prove her loyalty, she feels continually shut down. With her husband Shane working as a full-time lawyer, Emily Simpson fulfills her dreams of being a stay-at-home mom as she supports Annabelle\u2019s modeling aspirations, while continuing to help the wrongly convicted as part of the California Innocence Project. In a turn of events, Emily reconnects with Tamra, as the two develop a close friendship after working through their tumultuous past. Brought into the group through Tamra, new Housewife and yoga studio owner Jennifer Pedranti is a mother of five with children ranging from 5 to 18.  A strong advocate for fostering children and animals, she recently adopted her youngest child Dominic. She is currently navigating her recent split from her husband, Will, who runs her family business, as they share a home. Her friendship with Tamra is put to the test, as she is forced to explain cheating rumors and confront difficult truths. Taylor Armstrong moved to Orange County nearly ten years ago and is brought into the circle after becoming fast friends with Tamra. As Taylor pursues an acting career and is offered her first movie role, she seeks coaching and advice from Heather. \n\nCast:\nTamra Judge\nShannon Storms Beador\nHeather Dubrow\nGina Kirschenheiter\nEmily Simpson\nJennifer Pedranti\nTaylor Armstrong\n\nAbout Bravo:   \nBravo is the premier lifestyle and entertainment brand that drives cultural conversation around its high-quality, interactive original content across all platforms.

Tamra comes in hot and her reconciliation with Shannon does not go as planned. Tamra is holding everyone accountable, especially her friend Jennifer, but when the narrative doesn\u2019t add up, it leads to some explosive confrontations. Shannon Storms Beador is trying to keep the positive energy around as she looks to mend her fractured friendship and rebuild trust with her former bestie Tamra. Once Tamra and Shannon clear the air, it makes way for the Tres Amigas to reunite as the OG of the OC Vicki Gunvalson joins the fun for tequila and keg stands. With her twins off to college on opposite coasts, Heather Dubrow embraces a new chapter of her life.  Heather is determined to dive back into her acting career and launch a new business venture, but she questions whether she can accomplish it all. With the ladies, Heather lands herself in the middle of Tamra and Shannon\u2019s feud, but when they finally reconcile, she wonders where she fits in between their friendship. Gina Kirschenheiter and Travis join forces in real estate, hoping to be a dynamic duo, but first she has to pass the exam and get her license. She is informed that her style of friendship is not up to Heather\u2019s standards, but as Gina works to prove her loyalty, she feels continually shut down. With her husband Shane working as a full-time lawyer, Emily Simpson fulfills her dreams of being a stay-at-home mom as she supports Annabelle\u2019s modeling aspirations, while continuing to help the wrongly convicted as part of the California Innocence Project. In a turn of events, Emily reconnects with Tamra, as the two develop a close friendship after working through their tumultuous past. Brought into the group through Tamra, new Housewife and yoga studio owner Jennifer Pedranti is a mother of five with children ranging from 5 to 18.  A strong advocate for fostering children and animals, she recently adopted her youngest child Dominic. She is currently navigating her recent split from her husband, Will, who runs her family business, as they share a home. Her friendship with Tamra is put to the test, as she is forced to explain cheating rumors and confront difficult truths. Taylor Armstrong moved to Orange County nearly ten years ago and is brought into the circle after becoming fast friends with Tamra. As Taylor pursues an acting career and is offered her first movie role, she seeks coaching and advice from Heather. \n\nCast:\nTamra Judge\nShannon Storms Beador\nHeather Dubrow\nGina Kirschenheiter\nEmily Simpson\nJennifer Pedranti\nTaylor Armstrong\n\nAbout Bravo:   \nBravo is the premier lifestyle and entertainment brand that drives cultural conversation around its high-quality, interactive original content across all platforms.

Tamra is holding everyone accountable, especially her friend Jennifer, but when the narrative doesn\u2019t add up, it leads to some explosive confrontations. Shannon Storms Beador is trying to keep the positive energy around as she looks to mend her fractured friendship and rebuild trust with her former bestie Tamra. Once Tamra and Shannon clear the air, it makes way for the Tres Amigas to reunite as the OG of the OC Vicki Gunvalson joins the fun for tequila and keg stands.

With the ladies, Heather lands herself in the middle of Tamra and Shannon\u2019s feud, but when they finally reconcile, she wonders where she fits in between their friendship. Gina Kirschenheiter and Travis join forces in real estate, hoping to be a dynamic duo, but first she has to pass the exam and get her license. She is informed that her style of friendship is not up to Heather\u2019s standards, but as Gina works to prove her loyalty, she feels continually shut down. With her husband Shane working as a full-time lawyer, Emily Simpson fulfills her dreams of being a stay-at-home mom as she supports Annabelle\u2019s modeling aspirations, while continuing to help the wrongly convicted as part of the California Innocence Project.

Tamra is holding everyone accountable, especially her friend Jennifer, but when the narrative doesn\u2019t add up, it leads to some explosive confrontations. Shannon Storms Beador is trying to keep the positive energy around as she looks to mend her fractured friendship and rebuild trust with her former bestie Tamra. Once Tamra and Shannon clear the air, it makes way for the Tres Amigas to reunite as the OG of the OC Vicki Gunvalson joins the fun for tequila and keg stands. With her twins off to college on opposite coasts, Heather Dubrow embraces a new chapter of her life.  Heather is determined to dive back into her acting career and launch a new business venture, but she questions whether she can accomplish it all. With the ladies, Heather lands herself in the middle of Tamra and Shannon\u2019s feud, but when they finally reconcile, she wonders where she fits in between their friendship. Gina Kirschenheiter and Travis join forces in real estate, hoping to be a dynamic duo, but first she has to pass the exam and get her license. She is informed that her style of friendship is not up to Heather\u2019s standards, but as Gina works to prove her loyalty, she feels continually shut down. With her husband Shane working as a full-time lawyer, Emily Simpson fulfills her dreams of being a stay-at-home mom as she supports Annabelle\u2019s modeling aspirations, while continuing to help the wrongly convicted as part of the California Innocence Project. In a turn of events, Emily reconnects with Tamra, as the two develop a close friendship after working through their tumultuous past. Brought into the group through Tamra, new Housewife and yoga studio owner Jennifer Pedranti is a mother of five with children ranging from 5 to 18.  A strong advocate for fostering children and animals, she recently adopted her youngest child Dominic. She is currently navigating her recent split from her husband, Will, who runs her family business, as they share a home. Her friendship with Tamra is put to the test, as she is forced to explain cheating rumors and confront difficult truths. Taylor Armstrong moved to Orange County nearly ten years ago and is brought into the circle after becoming fast friends with Tamra. As Taylor pursues an acting career and is offered her first movie role, she seeks coaching and advice from Heather. \n\nCast:\nTamra Judge\nShannon Storms Beador\nHeather Dubrow\nGina Kerschenheiter\nEmily Simpson\nJennifer Pedranti\nTaylor Armstrong\n\nAbout Bravo:   \nBravo is the premier lifestyle and entertainment brand that drives cultural conversation around its high-quality, interactive original content across all platforms.

Watch the new season of RHOC, June 7th at 8/7c on Bravo.\n\n\u25ba\u25ba SUBSCRIBE: http://bravo.ly/Subscribe\n\u25ba\u25ba STREAM BRAVO ON PEACOCK HERE: http://pck.tv/2M6my4o \n\u25ba\u25ba WATCH FULL EPISODES NOW: https://bravo.app.link/WatchBravoYT         \n\u25ba\u25ba VISIT BRAVO\u2019S OFFICIAL SITE: http://bravo.ly/Official\n#Bravo #RHOC #SneakPeek\n\nAbout The Real Housewives of Orange County:\nAfter a two-year break, Tamra Judge is back with a new perspective and is ready to repair a few broken friendships. Tamra comes in hot and her reconciliation with Shannon does not go as planned. Tamra is holding everyone accountable, especially her friend Jennifer, but when the narrative doesn\u2019t add up, it leads to some explosive confrontations. Shannon Storms Beador is trying to keep the positive energy around as she looks to mend her fractured friendship and rebuild trust with her former bestie Tamra. Once Tamra and Shannon clear the air, it makes way for the Tres Amigas to reunite as the OG of the OC Vicki Gunvalson joins the fun for tequila and keg stands. With her twins off to college on opposite coasts, Heather Dubrow embraces a new chapter of her life.  Heather is determined to dive back into her acting career and launch a new business venture, but she questions whether she can accomplish it all. With the ladies, Heather lands herself in the middle of Tamra and Shannon\u2019s feud, but when they finally reconcile, she wonders where she fits in between their friendship. Gina Kirschenheiter and Travis join forces in real estate, hoping to be a dynamic duo, but first she has to pass the exam and get her license. She is informed that her style of friendship is not up to Heather\u2019s standards, but as Gina works to prove her loyalty, she feels continually shut down. With her husband Shane working as a full-time lawyer, Emily Simpson fulfills her dreams of being a stay-at-home mom as she supports Annabelle\u2019s modeling aspirations, while continuing to help the wrongly convicted as part of the California Innocence Project. In a turn of events, Emily reconnects with Tamra, as the two develop a close friendship after working through their tumultuous past. Brought into the group through Tamra, new Housewife and yoga studio owner Jennifer Pedranti is a mother of five with children ranging from 5 to 18.  A strong advocate for fostering children and animals, she recently adopted her youngest child Dominic. She is currently navigating her recent split from her husband, Will, who runs her family business, as they share a home. Her friendship with Tamra is put to the test, as she is forced to explain cheating rumors and confront difficult truths. Taylor Armstrong moved to Orange County nearly ten years ago and is brought into the circle after becoming fast friends with Tamra. As Taylor pursues an acting career and is offered her first movie role, she seeks coaching and advice from Heather. \n\nCast:\nTamra Judge\nShannon Storms Beador\nHeather Dubrow\nGina Kerschenheiter\nEmily Simpson\nJennifer Pedranti\nTaylor Armstrong\n\nAbout Bravo:   \nBravo is the premier lifestyle and entertainment brand that drives cultural conversation around its high-quality, interactive original content across all platforms.

To add to this, as rumors questioning the stability of their relationship begin to swirl, Reza is shocked to find that his best friend of 30 years might be the one to blame for the hearsay and his journey to uncover the truth changes everything.\n\nAfter nearly losing her life delivering her baby boy, Shams, Mercedes is left feeling abandoned by her friends who she claims did not visit her in the hospital. When the offended Reza decides to air his grievances on social media and takes it too far, Mercedes\u2019 husband Tommy does the unthinkable.\n\nMike is on top of the world and convinced that he\u2019s found \u201cthe one\u201d in his Persian-Jewish girlfriend, Paulina. Looking to prove to his family that his former bad-boy ways are behind him, he pursues a potential multi-million-dollar real estate deal solo despite his parents\u2019 reluctance to step back. \n\nA more mature Golnesa is finally ready to transition into the next phase of her life, and she embarks on a journey to become a mother via IVF. When a health complication threatens to derail her dream, she attempts to manifest good karma with those around her \u2013 but it proves difficult as she continues to clash with Mercedes.   \n\nOn the surface, Destiney is thriving in every aspect of her life: a growing business, healthy personal life and solid plans for her future. As she struggles to cope with her mother and sister moving out-of-state, she finds herself embroiled in a series of questionable circumstances that threaten her friendships within the group. \n\nNewly-single Nema is ready to mingle but finds it difficult to let go of his past with former girlfriend \u2013 and current colleague \u2013 Erica. While his relationship with his parents remains an ongoing struggle, Nema attempts to help Reza and MJ confront their issues and inadvertently causes a rift of his own.  \n\nReza\u2019s friend Sara is new to the group and though she attempts stay above the fray, she struggles to find her footing amongst the rambunctious crew. When skeletons from her past and issues with her family come to light, the poised image she tries so hard to maintain starts to crack.  \n#BravoTV #ShahsOfSunset\n\nGET MORE BRAVO:\nFollow Bravo: http://bravo.ly/Twitter\nLike Bravo: http://bravo.ly/Facebook\nFollow Bravo on Pinterest: https://www.pinterest.com/BravoTV\nBravo Instagram: http://bravo.ly/Instagram\nBravo Tumblr: http://bravo.ly/Tumblr\n\nBravo Media is the premiere lifestyle and entertainment brand that drives the cultural conversation around its high-quality, interactive original content that focuses on the network\u2019s passion points of food, fashion, beauty, design, digital and pop culture.

Mercedes Javid and Tommy Feight are new parents and their relationship together is stronger than ever! Reza Farahan and Mercedes Javid\u2019s friendship has gone sideways and Golnesa Gharachedaghi is an expecting mother! Everything is changing. Don\u2019t miss the Season 8 premiere on Sunday, February 9 @ 9/8c!\n\nHere's exactly where everyone is sitting...\n\u25ba\u25ba Subscribe for More: http://bravo.ly/Subscribe\n\u25ba\u25ba Visit the Official Site: http://bravo.ly/ Shahs of Sunset\n\u25ba\u25ba Watch Shahs of Sunset on Bravo!\n\nFOLLOW SHAHS OF SUNSET ON SOCIAL\nOfficial Site: http://bravo.ly/ShahsOfSunset\nFull Episodes & Clips: http://bravo.ly/ShahsOfSunsetVideos\nFacebook: http://bravo.ly/ShahsOfSunsetFacebook\n\nABOUT SHAHS OF SUNSET:\nReza finds himself at a crossroad in his personal life when he discovers that he and his husband Adam might not be on the same page about a major life decision. To add to this, as rumors questioning the stability of their relationship begin to swirl, Reza is shocked to find that his best friend of 30 years might be the one to blame for the hearsay and his journey to uncover the truth changes everything.\n\nAfter nearly losing her life delivering her baby boy, Shams, Mercedes is left feeling abandoned by her friends who she claims did not visit her in the hospital. When the offended Reza decides to air his grievances on social media and takes it too far, Mercedes\u2019 husband Tommy does the unthinkable.\n\nMike is on top of the world and convinced that he\u2019s found \u201cthe one\u201d in his Persian-Jewish girlfriend, Paulina. Looking to prove to his family that his former bad-boy ways are behind him, he pursues a potential multi-million-dollar real estate deal solo despite his parents\u2019 reluctance to step back. \n\nA more mature Golnesa is finally ready to transition into the next phase of her life, and she embarks on a journey to become a mother via IVF. When a health complication threatens to derail her dream, she attempts to manifest good karma with those around her \u2013 but it proves difficult as she continues to clash with Mercedes.   \n\nOn the surface, Destiney is thriving in every aspect of her life: a growing business, healthy personal life and solid plans for her future. As she struggles to cope with her mother and sister moving out-of-state, she finds herself embroiled in a series of questionable circumstances that threaten her friendships within the group. \n\nNewly-single Nema is ready to mingle but finds it difficult to let go of his past with former girlfriend \u2013 and current colleague \u2013 Erica. While his relationship with his parents remains an ongoing struggle, Nema attempts to help Reza and MJ confront their issues and inadvertently causes a rift of his own.  \n\nReza\u2019s friend Sara is new to the group and though she attempts stay above the fray, she struggles to find her footing amongst the rambunctious crew. When skeletons from her past and issues with her family come to light, the poised image she tries so hard to maintain starts to crack.  \n#BravoTV #ShahsOfSunset\n\nGET MORE BRAVO:\nFollow Bravo: http://bravo.ly/Twitter\nLike Bravo: http://bravo.ly/Facebook\nFollow Bravo on Pinterest: https://www.pinterest.com/BravoTV\nBravo Instagram: http://bravo.ly/Instagram\nBravo Tumblr: http://bravo.ly/Tumblr\n\nBravo Media is the premiere lifestyle and entertainment brand that drives the cultural conversation around its high-quality, interactive original content that focuses on the network\u2019s passion points of food, fashion, beauty, design, digital and pop culture.

To add to this, as rumors questioning the stability of their relationship begin to swirl, Reza is shocked to find that his best friend of 30 years might be the one to blame for the hearsay and his journey to uncover the truth changes everything.\n\nAfter nearly losing her life delivering her baby boy, Shams, Mercedes is left feeling abandoned by her friends who she claims did not visit her in the hospital. When the offended Reza decides to air his grievances on social media and takes it too far, Mercedes\u2019 husband Tommy does the unthinkable.\n\nMike is on top of the world and convinced that he\u2019s found \u201cthe one\u201d in his Persian-Jewish girlfriend, Paulina. Looking to prove to his family that his former bad-boy ways are behind him, he pursues a potential multi-million-dollar real estate deal solo despite his parents\u2019 reluctance to step back. \n\nA more mature Golnesa is finally ready to transition into the next phase of her life, and she embarks on a journey to become a mother via IVF.

As she struggles to cope with her mother and sister moving out-of-state, she finds herself embroiled in a series of questionable circumstances that threaten her friendships within the group. \n\nNewly-single Nema is ready to mingle but finds it difficult to let go of his past with former girlfriend \u2013 and current colleague \u2013 Erica.

When MJ finds herself plagued by indecision and self-doubt, the whole crew must come together to keep her steady and help get her down the aisle. Well into the second year of wedded bliss, Reza and his husband Adam are in the process of renovating their brand new house and settling down, but tensions build when one of Reza\u2019s investments interferes with Adam\u2019s surrogacy plans.

When MJ finds herself plagued by indecision and self-doubt, the whole crew must come together to keep her steady and help get her down the aisle. Well into the second year of wedded bliss, Reza and his husband Adam are in the process of renovating their brand new house and settling down, but tensions build when one of Reza\u2019s investments interferes with Adam\u2019s surrogacy plans. Mike, ever the alpha-male with unrealistically high expectations, is determined to find the next Mrs. Shouhed, but does not take well to bestie Reza\u2019s input on his dating choices, leading to a heated standoff during MJ\u2019s bachelorette party in Vegas. Destiney is eager to dip her toes into the dating pool, but realizes she must confront her own trust issues first. In an attempt to find peace, she hires a private detective to track down her absentee father, but what she finds leaves her questioning whether she can handle the truth. \n\nAfter a recent failed marriage, GG is on a quest for independence, but rethinks her decision to remain single and try for a baby on her own when newcomer Nema showers her with attention. Joining this audacious crew is never easy, but Nema manages to hold his own and quickly finds himself in a complicated love triangle. Looking to get to the root of his ongoing relationship struggles as an adult, the group bands together to help Nema gain the confidence to confront his unconventional family about his broken upbringing. \n\n#BravoTV #ShahsOfSunset\n\nGET MORE BRAVO:\nFollow Bravo: http://bravo.ly/Twitter\nLike Bravo: http://bravo.ly/Facebook\nFollow Bravo on Pinterest: https://www.pinterest.com/BravoTV\nBravo Instagram: http://bravo.ly/Instagram\nBravo Tumblr: http://bravo.ly/Tumblr\n\nBravo Media is the premiere lifestyle and entertainment brand that drives the cultural conversation around its high-quality, interactive original content that focuses on the network\u2019s passion points of food, fashion, beauty, design, digital and pop culture.

When MJ finds herself plagued by indecision and self-doubt, the whole crew must come together to keep her steady and help get her down the aisle. Well into the second year of wedded bliss, Reza and his husband Adam are in the process of renovating their brand new house and settling down, but tensions build when one of Reza\u2019s investments interferes with Adam\u2019s surrogacy plans. Mike, ever the alpha-male with unrealistically high expectations, is determined to find the next Mrs. Shouhed, but does not take well to bestie Reza\u2019s input on his dating choices, leading to a heated standoff during MJ\u2019s bachelorette party in Vegas.

When MJ finds herself plagued by indecision and self-doubt, the whole crew must come together to keep her steady and help get her down the aisle. Well into the second year of wedded bliss, Reza and his husband Adam are in the process of renovating their brand new house and settling down, but tensions build when one of Reza\u2019s investments interferes with Adam\u2019s surrogacy plans. Mike, ever the alpha-male with unrealistically high expectations, is determined to find the next Mrs. Shouhed, but does not take well to bestie Reza\u2019s input on his dating choices, leading to a heated standoff during MJ\u2019s bachelorette party in Vegas. Destiney is eager to dip her toes into the dating pool, but realizes she must confront her own trust issues first. In an attempt to find peace, she hires a private detective to track down her absentee father, but what she finds leaves her questioning whether she can handle the truth. \n\nAfter a recent failed marriage, GG is on a quest for independence, but rethinks her decision to remain single and try for a baby on her own when newcomer Nema showers her with attention.

When MJ finds herself plagued by indecision and self-doubt, the whole crew must come together to keep her steady and help get her down the aisle. Well into the second year of wedded bliss, Reza and his husband Adam are in the process of renovating their brand new house and settling down, but tensions build when one of Reza\u2019s investments interferes with Adam\u2019s surrogacy plans. Mike, ever the alpha-male with unrealistically high expectations, is determined to find the next Mrs. Shouhed, but does not take well to bestie Reza\u2019s input on his dating choices, leading to a heated standoff during MJ\u2019s bachelorette party in Vegas. Destiney is eager to dip her toes into the dating pool, but realizes she must confront her own trust issues first. In an attempt to find peace, she hires a private detective to track down her absentee father, but what she finds leaves her questioning whether she can handle the truth. \n\nAfter a recent failed marriage, GG is on a quest for independence, but rethinks her decision to remain single and try for a baby on her own when newcomer Nema showers her with attention.

When MJ finds herself plagued by indecision and self-doubt, the whole crew must come together to keep her steady and help get her down the aisle. Well into the second year of wedded bliss, Reza and his husband Adam are in the process of renovating their brand new house and settling down, but tensions build when one of Reza\u2019s investments interferes with Adam\u2019s surrogacy plans. Mike, ever the alpha-male with unrealistically high expectations, is determined to find the next Mrs. Shouhed, but does not take well to bestie Reza\u2019s input on his dating choices, leading to a heated standoff during MJ\u2019s bachelorette party in Vegas. Destiney is eager to dip her toes into the dating pool, but realizes she must confront her own trust issues first. In an attempt to find peace, she hires a private detective to track down her absentee father, but what she finds leaves her questioning whether she can handle the truth. \n\nAfter a recent failed marriage, GG is on a quest for independence, but rethinks her decision to remain single and try for a baby on her own when newcomer Nema showers her with attention. Joining this audacious crew is never easy, but Nema manages to hold his own and quickly finds himself in a complicated love triangle. Looking to get to the root of his ongoing relationship struggles as an adult, the group bands together to help Nema gain the confidence to confront his unconventional family about his broken upbringing. \n\n#BravoTV #ShahsOfSunset\n\nGET MORE BRAVO:\nFollow Bravo: http://bravo.ly/Twitter\nLike Bravo: http://bravo.ly/Facebook\nFollow Bravo on Pinterest: https://www.pinterest.com/BravoTV\nBravo Instagram: http://bravo.ly/Instagram\nBravo Tumblr: http://bravo.ly/Tumblr\n\nBravo Media is the premiere lifestyle and entertainment brand that drives the cultural conversation around its high-quality, interactive original content that focuses on the network\u2019s passion points of food, fashion, beauty, design, digital and pop culture.

When MJ finds herself plagued by indecision and self-doubt, the whole crew must come together to keep her steady and help get her down the aisle. Well into the second year of wedded bliss, Reza and his husband Adam are in the process of renovating their brand new house and settling down, but tensions build when one of Reza\u2019s investments interferes with Adam\u2019s surrogacy plans. Mike, ever the alpha-male with unrealistically high expectations, is determined to find the next Mrs. Shouhed, but does not take well to bestie Reza\u2019s input on his dating choices, leading to a heated standoff during MJ\u2019s bachelorette party in Vegas. Destiney is eager to dip her toes into the dating pool, but realizes she must confront her own trust issues first. In an attempt to find peace, she hires a private detective to track down her absentee father, but what she finds leaves her questioning whether she can handle the truth. \n\nAfter a recent failed marriage, GG is on a quest for independence, but rethinks her decision to remain single and try for a baby on her own when newcomer Nema showers her with attention. Joining this audacious crew is never easy, but Nema manages to hold his own and quickly finds himself in a complicated love triangle. Looking to get to the root of his ongoing relationship struggles as an adult, the group bands together to help Nema gain the confidence to confront his unconventional family about his broken upbringing. \n\n#BravoTV #ShahsOfSunset\n\nGET MORE BRAVO:\nFollow Bravo: http://bravo.ly/Twitter\nLike Bravo: http://bravo.ly/Facebook\nFollow Bravo on Pinterest: https://www.pinterest.com/BravoTV\nBravo Instagram: http://bravo.ly/Instagram\nBravo Tumblr: http://bravo.ly/Tumblr\n\nBravo Media is the premiere lifestyle and entertainment brand that drives the cultural conversation around its high-quality, interactive original content that focuses on the network\u2019s passion points of food, fashion, beauty, design, digital and pop culture.

When MJ finds herself plagued by indecision and self-doubt, the whole crew must come together to keep her steady and help get her down the aisle. Well into the second year of wedded bliss, Reza and his husband Adam are in the process of renovating their brand new house and settling down, but tensions build when one of Reza\u2019s investments interferes with Adam\u2019s surrogacy plans. Mike, ever the alpha-male with unrealistically high expectations, is determined to find the next Mrs. Shouhed, but does not take well to bestie Reza\u2019s input on his dating choices, leading to a heated standoff during MJ\u2019s bachelorette party in Vegas. Destiney is eager to dip her toes into the dating pool, but realizes she must confront her own trust issues first. In an attempt to find peace, she hires a private detective to track down her absentee father, but what she finds leaves her questioning whether she can handle the truth. \n\nAfter a recent failed marriage, GG is on a quest for independence, but rethinks her decision to remain single and try for a baby on her own when newcomer Nema showers her with attention. Joining this audacious crew is never easy, but Nema manages to hold his own and quickly finds himself in a complicated love triangle. Looking to get to the root of his ongoing relationship struggles as an adult, the group bands together to help Nema gain the confidence to confront his unconventional family about his broken upbringing. \n\n#BravoTV #ShahsOfSunset\n\nGET MORE BRAVO:\nFollow Bravo: http://bravo.ly/Twitter\nLike Bravo: http://bravo.ly/Facebook\nFollow Bravo on Pinterest: https://www.pinterest.com/BravoTV\nBravo Instagram: http://bravo.ly/Instagram\nBravo Tumblr: http://bravo.ly/Tumblr\n\nBravo Media is the premiere lifestyle and entertainment brand that drives the cultural conversation around its high-quality, interactive original content that focuses on the network\u2019s passion points of food, fashion, beauty, design, digital and pop culture.

When MJ finds herself plagued by indecision and self-doubt, the whole crew must come together to keep her steady and help get her down the aisle. Well into the second year of wedded bliss, Reza and his husband Adam are in the process of renovating their brand new house and settling down, but tensions build when one of Reza\u2019s investments interferes with Adam\u2019s surrogacy plans. Mike, ever the alpha-male with unrealistically high expectations, is determined to find the next Mrs. Shouhed, but does not take well to bestie Reza\u2019s input on his dating choices, leading to a heated standoff during MJ\u2019s bachelorette party in Vegas. Destiney is eager to dip her toes into the dating pool, but realizes she must confront her own trust issues first. In an attempt to find peace, she hires a private detective to track down her absentee father, but what she finds leaves her questioning whether she can handle the truth. \n\nAfter a recent failed marriage, GG is on a quest for independence, but rethinks her decision to remain single and try for a baby on her own when newcomer Nema showers her with attention. Joining this audacious crew is never easy, but Nema manages to hold his own and quickly finds himself in a complicated love triangle. Looking to get to the root of his ongoing relationship struggles as an adult, the group bands together to help Nema gain the confidence to confront his unconventional family about his broken upbringing. \n\n#BravoTV #ShahsOfSunset\n\nGET MORE BRAVO:\nFollow Bravo: http://bravo.ly/Twitter\nLike Bravo: http://bravo.ly/Facebook\nFollow Bravo on Pinterest: https://www.pinterest.com/BravoTV\nBravo Instagram: http://bravo.ly/Instagram\nBravo Tumblr: http://bravo.ly/Tumblr\n\nBravo Media is the premiere lifestyle and entertainment brand that drives the cultural conversation around its high-quality, interactive original content that focuses on the network\u2019s passion points of food, fashion, beauty, design, digital and pop culture.

Destiney is eager to dip her toes into the dating pool, but realizes she must confront her own trust issues first. In an attempt to find peace, she hires a private detective to track down her absentee father, but what she finds leaves her questioning whether she can handle the truth. \n\nAfter a recent failed marriage, GG is on a quest for independence, but rethinks her decision to remain single and try for a baby on her own when newcomer Nema showers her with attention. Joining this audacious crew is never easy, but Nema manages to hold his own and quickly finds himself in a complicated love triangle. Looking to get to the root of his ongoing relationship struggles as an adult, the group bands together to help Nema gain the confidence to confront his unconventional family about his broken upbringing. \n\n#BravoTV #ShahsOfSunset\n\nGET MORE BRAVO:\nFollow Bravo: http://bravo.ly/Twitter\nLike Bravo: http://bravo.ly/Facebook\nFollow Bravo on Pinterest: https://www.pinterest.com/BravoTV\nBravo Instagram: http://bravo.ly/Instagram\nBravo Tumblr: http://bravo.ly/Tumblr\n\nBravo Media is the premiere lifestyle and entertainment brand that drives the cultural conversation around its high-quality, interactive original content that focuses on the network\u2019s passion points of food, fashion, beauty, design, digital and pop culture.

When MJ finds herself plagued by indecision and self-doubt, the whole crew must come together to keep her steady and help get her down the aisle. Well into the second year of wedded bliss, Reza and his husband Adam are in the process of renovating their brand new house and settling down, but tensions build when one of Reza\u2019s investments interferes with Adam\u2019s surrogacy plans. Mike, ever the alpha-male with unrealistically high expectations, is determined to find the next Mrs. Shouhed, but does not take well to bestie Reza\u2019s input on his dating choices, leading to a heated standoff during MJ\u2019s bachelorette party in Vegas. Destiney is eager to dip her toes into the dating pool, but realizes she must confront her own trust issues first. In an attempt to find peace, she hires a private detective to track down her absentee father, but what she finds leaves her questioning whether she can handle the truth. \n\nAfter a recent failed marriage, GG is on a quest for independence, but rethinks her decision to remain single and try for a baby on her own when newcomer Nema showers her with attention. Joining this audacious crew is never easy, but Nema manages to hold his own and quickly finds himself in a complicated love triangle. Looking to get to the root of his ongoing relationship struggles as an adult, the group bands together to help Nema gain the confidence to confront his unconventional family about his broken upbringing. \n\n#BravoTV #ShahsOfSunset\n\nGET MORE BRAVO:\nFollow Bravo: http://bravo.ly/Twitter\nLike Bravo: http://bravo.ly/Facebook\nFollow Bravo on Pinterest: https://www.pinterest.com/BravoTV\nBravo Instagram: http://bravo.ly/Instagram\nBravo Tumblr: http://bravo.ly/Tumblr\n\nBravo Media is the premiere lifestyle and entertainment brand that drives the cultural conversation around its high-quality, interactive original content that focuses on the network\u2019s passion points of food, fashion, beauty, design, digital and pop culture.

When MJ finds herself plagued by indecision and self-doubt, the whole crew must come together to keep her steady and help get her down the aisle.

Mike, ever the alpha-male with unrealistically high expectations, is determined to find the next Mrs. Shouhed, but does not take well to bestie Reza\u2019s input on his dating choices, leading to a heated standoff during MJ\u2019s bachelorette party in Vegas. Destiney is eager to dip her toes into the dating pool, but realizes she must confront her own trust issues first. In an attempt to find peace, she hires a private detective to track down her absentee father, but what she finds leaves her questioning whether she can handle the truth. \n\nAfter a recent failed marriage, GG is on a quest for independence, but rethinks her decision to remain single and try for a baby on her own when newcomer Nema showers her with attention. Joining this audacious crew is never easy, but Nema manages to hold his own and quickly finds himself in a complicated love triangle.

When MJ finds herself plagued by indecision and self-doubt, the whole crew must come together to keep her steady and help get her down the aisle. Well into the second year of wedded bliss, Reza and his husband Adam are in the process of renovating their brand new house and settling down, but tensions build when one of Reza\u2019s investments interferes with Adam\u2019s surrogacy plans. Mike, ever the alpha-male with unrealistically high expectations, is determined to find the next Mrs. Shouhed, but does not take well to bestie Reza\u2019s input on his dating choices, leading to a heated standoff during MJ\u2019s bachelorette party in Vegas. Destiney is eager to dip her toes into the dating pool, but realizes she must confront her own trust issues first. In an attempt to find peace, she hires a private detective to track down her absentee father, but what she finds leaves her questioning whether she can handle the truth. \n\nAfter a recent failed marriage, GG is on a quest for independence, but rethinks her decision to remain single and try for a baby on her own when newcomer Nema showers her with attention.

When MJ finds herself plagued by indecision and self-doubt, the whole crew must come together to keep her steady and help get her down the aisle. Well into the second year of wedded bliss, Reza and his husband Adam are in the process of renovating their brand new house and settling down, but tensions build when one of Reza\u2019s investments interferes with Adam\u2019s surrogacy plans. Mike, ever the alpha-male with unrealistically high expectations, is determined to find the next Mrs. Shouhed, but does not take well to bestie Reza\u2019s input on his dating choices, leading to a heated standoff during MJ\u2019s bachelorette party in Vegas. Destiney is eager to dip her toes into the dating pool, but realizes she must confront her own trust issues first. In an attempt to find peace, she hires a private detective to track down her absentee father, but what she finds leaves her questioning whether she can handle the truth. \n\nAfter a recent failed marriage, GG is on a quest for independence, but rethinks her decision to remain single and try for a baby on her own when newcomer Nema showers her with attention. Joining this audacious crew is never easy, but Nema manages to hold his own and quickly finds himself in a complicated love triangle. Looking to get to the root of his ongoing relationship struggles as an adult, the group bands together to help Nema gain the confidence to confront his unconventional family about his broken upbringing. \n\n#BravoTV #ShahsOfSunset\n\nGET MORE BRAVO:\nFollow Bravo: http://bravo.ly/Twitter\nLike Bravo: http://bravo.ly/Facebook\nFollow Bravo on Pinterest: https://www.pinterest.com/BravoTV\nBravo Instagram: http://bravo.ly/Instagram\nBravo Tumblr: http://bravo.ly/Tumblr\n\nBravo Media is the premiere lifestyle and entertainment brand that drives the cultural conversation around its high-quality, interactive original content that focuses on the network\u2019s passion points of food, fashion, beauty, design, digital and pop culture.

When MJ finds herself plagued by indecision and self-doubt, the whole crew must come together to keep her steady and help get her down the aisle. Well into the second year of wedded bliss, Reza and his husband Adam are in the process of renovating their brand new house and settling down, but tensions build when one of Reza\u2019s investments interferes with Adam\u2019s surrogacy plans. Mike, ever the alpha-male with unrealistically high expectations, is determined to find the next Mrs. Shouhed, but does not take well to bestie Reza\u2019s input on his dating choices, leading to a heated standoff during MJ\u2019s bachelorette party in Vegas. Destiney is eager to dip her toes into the dating pool, but realizes she must confront her own trust issues first. In an attempt to find peace, she hires a private detective to track down her absentee father, but what she finds leaves her questioning whether she can handle the truth. \n\nAfter a recent failed marriage, GG is on a quest for independence, but rethinks her decision to remain single and try for a baby on her own when newcomer Nema showers her with attention. Joining this audacious crew is never easy, but Nema manages to hold his own and quickly finds himself in a complicated love triangle. Looking to get to the root of his ongoing relationship struggles as an adult, the group bands together to help Nema gain the confidence to confront his unconventional family about his broken upbringing. \n\n#BravoTV #ShahsOfSunset\n\nGET MORE BRAVO:\nFollow Bravo: http://bravo.ly/Twitter\nLike Bravo: http://bravo.ly/Facebook\nPin Bravo: http://bravo.ly/Pinterest\nBravo Instagram: http://bravo.ly/Instagram\nBravo Tumblr: http://bravo.ly/Tumblr\n\nBravo Media is the premiere lifestyle and entertainment brand that drives the cultural conversation around its high-quality, interactive original content that focuses on the network\u2019s passion points of food, fashion, beauty, design, digital and pop culture.

When MJ finds herself plagued by indecision and self-doubt, the whole crew must come together to keep her steady and help get her down the aisle. Well into the second year of wedded bliss, Reza and his husband Adam are in the process of renovating their brand new house and settling down, but tensions build when one of Reza\u2019s investments interferes with Adam\u2019s surrogacy plans. Mike, ever the alpha-male with unrealistically high expectations, is determined to find the next Mrs. Shouhed, but does not take well to bestie Reza\u2019s input on his dating choices, leading to a heated standoff during MJ\u2019s bachelorette party in Vegas. Destiney is eager to dip her toes into the dating pool, but realizes she must confront her own trust issues first. In an attempt to find peace, she hires a private detective to track down her absentee father, but what she finds leaves her questioning whether she can handle the truth. \n\nAfter a recent failed marriage, GG is on a quest for independence, but rethinks her decision to remain single and try for a baby on her own when newcomer Nema showers her with attention.

When MJ finds herself plagued by indecision and self-doubt, the whole crew must come together to keep her steady and help get her down the aisle. Well into the second year of wedded bliss, Reza and his husband Adam are in the process of renovating their brand new house and settling down, but tensions build when one of Reza\u2019s investments interferes with Adam\u2019s surrogacy plans. Mike, ever the alpha-male with unrealistically high expectations, is determined to find the next Mrs. Shouhed, but does not take well to bestie Reza\u2019s input on his dating choices, leading to a heated standoff during MJ\u2019s bachelorette party in Vegas. Destiney is eager to dip her toes into the dating pool, but realizes she must confront her own trust issues first. In an attempt to find peace, she hires a private detective to track down her absentee father, but what she finds leaves her questioning whether she can handle the truth. \n\nAfter a recent failed marriage, GG is on a quest for independence, but rethinks her decision to remain single and try for a baby on her own when newcomer Nema showers her with attention. Joining this audacious crew is never easy, but Nema manages to hold his own and quickly finds himself in a complicated love triangle. Looking to get to the root of his ongoing relationship struggles as an adult, the group bands together to help Nema gain the confidence to confront his unconventional family about his broken upbringing. \n\n#BravoTV #ShahsOfSunset\n\nGET MORE BRAVO:\nFollow Bravo: http://bravo.ly/Twitter\nLike Bravo: http://bravo.ly/Facebook\nFollow Bravo on Pinterest: https://www.pinterest.com/BravoTV\nBravo Instagram: http://bravo.ly/Instagram\nBravo Tumblr: http://bravo.ly/Tumblr\n\nBravo Media is the premiere lifestyle and entertainment brand that drives the cultural conversation around its high-quality, interactive original content that focuses on the network\u2019s passion points of food, fashion, beauty, design, digital and pop culture.

When MJ finds herself plagued by indecision and self-doubt, the whole crew must come together to keep her steady and help get her down the aisle. Well into the second year of wedded bliss, Reza and his husband Adam are in the process of renovating their brand new house and settling down, but tensions build when one of Reza\u2019s investments interferes with Adam\u2019s surrogacy plans. Mike, ever the alpha-male with unrealistically high expectations, is determined to find the next Mrs. Shouhed, but does not take well to bestie Reza\u2019s input on his dating choices, leading to a heated standoff during MJ\u2019s bachelorette party in Vegas. Destiney is eager to dip her toes into the dating pool, but realizes she must confront her own trust issues first. In an attempt to find peace, she hires a private detective to track down her absentee father, but what she finds leaves her questioning whether she can handle the truth. \n\nAfter a recent failed marriage, GG is on a quest for independence, but rethinks her decision to remain single and try for a baby on her own when newcomer Nema showers her with attention. Joining this audacious crew is never easy, but Nema manages to hold his own and quickly finds himself in a complicated love triangle.

When MJ finds herself plagued by indecision and self-doubt, the whole crew must come together to keep her steady and help get her down the aisle. Well into the second year of wedded bliss, Reza and his husband Adam are in the process of renovating their brand new house and settling down, but tensions build when one of Reza\u2019s investments interferes with Adam\u2019s surrogacy plans. Mike, ever the alpha-male with unrealistically high expectations, is determined to find the next Mrs. Shouhed, but does not take well to bestie Reza\u2019s input on his dating choices, leading to a heated standoff during MJ\u2019s bachelorette party in Vegas. Destiney is eager to dip her toes into the dating pool, but realizes she must confront her own trust issues first. In an attempt to find peace, she hires a private detective to track down her absentee father, but what she finds leaves her questioning whether she can handle the truth. \n\nAfter a recent failed marriage, GG is on a quest for independence, but rethinks her decision to remain single and try for a baby on her own when newcomer Nema showers her with attention.

When MJ finds herself plagued by indecision and self-doubt, the whole crew must come together to keep her steady and help get her down the aisle. Well into the second year of wedded bliss, Reza and his husband Adam are in the process of renovating their brand new house and settling down, but tensions build when one of Reza\u2019s investments interferes with Adam\u2019s surrogacy plans. Mike, ever the alpha-male with unrealistically high expectations, is determined to find the next Mrs. Shouhed, but does not take well to bestie Reza\u2019s input on his dating choices, leading to a heated standoff during MJ\u2019s bachelorette party in Vegas. Destiney is eager to dip her toes into the dating pool, but realizes she must confront her own trust issues first. In an attempt to find peace, she hires a private detective to track down her absentee father, but what she finds leaves her questioning whether she can handle the truth. \n\nAfter a recent failed marriage, GG is on a quest for independence, but rethinks her decision to remain single and try for a baby on her own when newcomer Nema showers her with attention. Joining this audacious crew is never easy, but Nema manages to hold his own and quickly finds himself in a complicated love triangle.

When MJ finds herself plagued by indecision and self-doubt, the whole crew must come together to keep her steady and help get her down the aisle. Well into the second year of wedded bliss, Reza and his husband Adam are in the process of renovating their brand new house and settling down, but tensions build when one of Reza\u2019s investments interferes with Adam\u2019s surrogacy plans. Mike, ever the alpha-male with unrealistically high expectations, is determined to find the next Mrs. Shouhed, but does not take well to bestie Reza\u2019s input on his dating choices, leading to a heated standoff during MJ\u2019s bachelorette party in Vegas. Destiney is eager to dip her toes into the dating pool, but realizes she must confront her own trust issues first. In an attempt to find peace, she hires a private detective to track down her absentee father, but what she finds leaves her questioning whether she can handle the truth. \n\nAfter a recent failed marriage, GG is on a quest for independence, but rethinks her decision to remain single and try for a baby on her own when newcomer Nema showers her with attention. Joining this audacious crew is never easy, but Nema manages to hold his own and quickly finds himself in a complicated love triangle. Looking to get to the root of his ongoing relationship struggles as an adult, the group bands together to help Nema gain the confidence to confront his unconventional family about his broken upbringing. \n\n#BravoTV #ShahsOfSunset\n\nGET MORE BRAVO:\nFollow Bravo: http://bravo.ly/Twitter\nLike Bravo: http://bravo.ly/Facebook\nFollow Bravo on Pinterest: https://www.pinterest.com/BravoTV\nBravo Instagram: http://bravo.ly/Instagram\nBravo Tumblr: http://bravo.ly/Tumblr\n\nBravo Media is the premiere lifestyle and entertainment brand that drives the cultural conversation around its high-quality, interactive original content that focuses on the network\u2019s passion points of food, fashion, beauty, design, digital and pop culture.

When MJ finds herself plagued by indecision and self-doubt, the whole crew must come together to keep her steady and help get her down the aisle. Well into the second year of wedded bliss, Reza and his husband Adam are in the process of renovating their brand new house and settling down, but tensions build when one of Reza\u2019s investments interferes with Adam\u2019s surrogacy plans. Mike, ever the alpha-male with unrealistically high expectations, is determined to find the next Mrs. Shouhed, but does not take well to bestie Reza\u2019s input on his dating choices, leading to a heated standoff during MJ\u2019s bachelorette party in Vegas.

When MJ finds herself plagued by indecision and self-doubt, the whole crew must come together to keep her steady and help get her down the aisle. Well into the second year of wedded bliss, Reza and his husband Adam are in the process of renovating their brand new house and settling down, but tensions build when one of Reza\u2019s investments interferes with Adam\u2019s surrogacy plans. Mike, ever the alpha-male with unrealistically high expectations, is determined to find the next Mrs. Shouhed, but does not take well to bestie Reza\u2019s input on his dating choices, leading to a heated standoff during MJ\u2019s bachelorette party in Vegas.

In an attempt to find peace, she hires a private detective to track down her absentee father, but what she finds leaves her questioning whether she can handle the truth. \n\nAfter a recent failed marriage, GG is on a quest for independence, but rethinks her decision to remain single and try for a baby on her own when newcomer Nema showers her with attention.

When MJ finds herself plagued by indecision and self-doubt, the whole crew must come together to keep her steady and help get her down the aisle. Well into the second year of wedded bliss, Reza and his husband Adam are in the process of renovating their brand new house and settling down, but tensions build when one of Reza\u2019s investments interferes with Adam\u2019s surrogacy plans. Mike, ever the alpha-male with unrealistically high expectations, is determined to find the next Mrs. Shouhed, but does not take well to bestie Reza\u2019s input on his dating choices, leading to a heated standoff during MJ\u2019s bachelorette party in Vegas. Destiney is eager to dip her toes into the dating pool, but realizes she must confront her own trust issues first. In an attempt to find peace, she hires a private detective to track down her absentee father, but what she finds leaves her questioning whether she can handle the truth. \n\nAfter a recent failed marriage, GG is on a quest for independence, but rethinks her decision to remain single and try for a baby on her own when newcomer Nema showers her with attention. Joining this audacious crew is never easy, but Nema manages to hold his own and quickly finds himself in a complicated love triangle.

When MJ finds herself plagued by indecision and self-doubt, the whole crew must come together to keep her steady and help get her down the aisle. Well into the second year of wedded bliss, Reza and his husband Adam are in the process of renovating their brand new house and settling down, but tensions build when one of Reza\u2019s investments interferes with Adam\u2019s surrogacy plans. Mike, ever the alpha-male with unrealistically high expectations, is determined to find the next Mrs. Shouhed, but does not take well to bestie Reza\u2019s input on his dating choices, leading to a heated standoff during MJ\u2019s bachelorette party in Vegas. Destiney is eager to dip her toes into the dating pool, but realizes she must confront her own trust issues first. In an attempt to find peace, she hires a private detective to track down her absentee father, but what she finds leaves her questioning whether she can handle the truth. \n\nAfter a recent failed marriage, GG is on a quest for independence, but rethinks her decision to remain single and try for a baby on her own when newcomer Nema showers her with attention.

Mike, ever the alpha-male with unrealistically high expectations, is determined to find the next Mrs. Shouhed, but does not take well to bestie Reza\u2019s input on his dating choices, leading to a heated standoff during MJ\u2019s bachelorette party in Vegas. Destiney is eager to dip her toes into the dating pool, but realizes she must confront her own trust issues first. In an attempt to find peace, she hires a private detective to track down her absentee father, but what she finds leaves her questioning whether she can handle the truth. \n\nAfter a recent failed marriage, GG is on a quest for independence, but rethinks her decision to remain single and try for a baby on her own when newcomer Nema showers her with attention.

When MJ finds herself plagued by indecision and self-doubt, the whole crew must come together to keep her steady and help get her down the aisle. Well into the second year of wedded bliss, Reza and his husband Adam are in the process of renovating their brand new house and settling down, but tensions build when one of Reza\u2019s investments interferes with Adam\u2019s surrogacy plans. Mike, ever the alpha-male with unrealistically high expectations, is determined to find the next Mrs. Shouhed, but does not take well to bestie Reza\u2019s input on his dating choices, leading to a heated standoff during MJ\u2019s bachelorette party in Vegas. Destiney is eager to dip her toes into the dating pool, but realizes she must confront her own trust issues first. In an attempt to find peace, she hires a private detective to track down her absentee father, but what she finds leaves her questioning whether she can handle the truth. \n\nAfter a recent failed marriage, GG is on a quest for independence, but rethinks her decision to remain single and try for a baby on her own when newcomer Nema showers her with attention.

When MJ finds herself plagued by indecision and self-doubt, the whole crew must come together to keep her steady and help get her down the aisle. Well into the second year of wedded bliss, Reza and his husband Adam are in the process of renovating their brand new house and settling down, but tensions build when one of Reza\u2019s investments interferes with Adam\u2019s surrogacy plans. Mike, ever the alpha-male with unrealistically high expectations, is determined to find the next Mrs. Shouhed, but does not take well to bestie Reza\u2019s input on his dating choices, leading to a heated standoff during MJ\u2019s bachelorette party in Vegas. Destiney is eager to dip her toes into the dating pool, but realizes she must confront her own trust issues first. In an attempt to find peace, she hires a private detective to track down her absentee father, but what she finds leaves her questioning whether she can handle the truth. \n\nAfter a recent failed marriage, GG is on a quest for independence, but rethinks her decision to remain single and try for a baby on her own when newcomer Nema showers her with attention.

When MJ finds herself plagued by indecision and self-doubt, the whole crew must come together to keep her steady and help get her down the aisle. Well into the second year of wedded bliss, Reza and his husband Adam are in the process of renovating their brand new house and settling down, but tensions build when one of Reza\u2019s investments interferes with Adam\u2019s surrogacy plans. Mike, ever the alpha-male with unrealistically high expectations, is determined to find the next Mrs. Shouhed, but does not take well to bestie Reza\u2019s input on his dating choices, leading to a heated standoff during MJ\u2019s bachelorette party in Vegas. Destiney is eager to dip her toes into the dating pool, but realizes she must confront her own trust issues first. In an attempt to find peace, she hires a private detective to track down her absentee father, but what she finds leaves her questioning whether she can handle the truth. \n\nAfter a recent failed marriage, GG is on a quest for independence, but rethinks her decision to remain single and try for a baby on her own when newcomer Nema showers her with attention.

When MJ finds herself plagued by indecision and self-doubt, the whole crew must come together to keep her steady and help get her down the aisle. Well into the second year of wedded bliss, Reza and his husband Adam are in the process of renovating their brand new house and settling down, but tensions build when one of Reza\u2019s investments interferes with Adam\u2019s surrogacy plans. Mike, ever the alpha-male with unrealistically high expectations, is determined to find the next Mrs. Shouhed, but does not take well to bestie Reza\u2019s input on his dating choices, leading to a heated standoff during MJ\u2019s bachelorette party in Vegas. Destiney is eager to dip her toes into the dating pool, but realizes she must confront her own trust issues first. In an attempt to find peace, she hires a private detective to track down her absentee father, but what she finds leaves her questioning whether she can handle the truth. \n\nAfter a recent failed marriage, GG is on a quest for independence, but rethinks her decision to remain single and try for a baby on her own when newcomer Nema showers her with attention.

Sara Jeihooni asks her brother not to have sex with Destiney Rose. Meanwhile, GG prepares for embryo transfer.\n\n\u25ba\u25ba Subscribe for More: http://bravo.ly/Subscribe\n\u25ba\u25ba Visit the Official Site: http://bravo.ly/ Shahs of Sunset\n\u25ba\u25ba Watch Shahs of Sunset on Bravo!\n\nFOLLOW SHAHS OF SUNSET ON SOCIAL\nOfficial Site: http://bravo.ly/ShahsOfSunset\nFull Episodes & Clips: http://bravo.ly/ShahsOfSunsetVideos\nFacebook: http://bravo.ly/ShahsOfSunsetFacebook\n\nABOUT SHAHS OF SUNSET:\nReza finds himself at a crossroad in his personal life when he discovers that he and his husband Adam might not be on the same page about a major life decision. To add to this, as rumors questioning the stability of their relationship begin to swirl, Reza is shocked to find that his best friend of 30 years might be the one to blame for the hearsay and his journey to uncover the truth changes everything.\n\nAfter nearly losing her life delivering her baby boy, Shams, Mercedes is left feeling abandoned by her friends who she claims did not visit her in the hospital. When the offended Reza decides to air his grievances on social media and takes it too far, Mercedes\u2019 husband Tommy does the unthinkable.\n\nMike is on top of the world and convinced that he\u2019s found \u201cthe one\u201d in his Persian-Jewish girlfriend, Paulina. Looking to prove to his family that his former bad-boy ways are behind him, he pursues a potential multi-million-dollar real estate deal solo despite his parents\u2019 reluctance to step back. \n\nA more mature Golnesa is finally ready to transition into the next phase of her life, and she embarks on a journey to become a mother via IVF. When a health complication threatens to derail her dream, she attempts to manifest good karma with those around her \u2013 but it proves difficult as she continues to clash with Mercedes.   \n\nOn the surface, Destiney is thriving in every aspect of her life: a growing business, healthy personal life and solid plans for her future. As she struggles to cope with her mother and sister moving out-of-state, she finds herself embroiled in a series of questionable circumstances that threaten her friendships within the group. \n\nNewly-single Nema is ready to mingle but finds it difficult to let go of his past with former girlfriend \u2013 and current colleague \u2013 Erica. While his relationship with his parents remains an ongoing struggle, Nema attempts to help Reza and MJ confront their issues and inadvertently causes a rift of his own.  \n\nReza\u2019s friend Sara is new to the group and though she attempts stay above the fray, she struggles to find her footing amongst the rambunctious crew. When skeletons from her past and issues with her family come to light, the poised image she tries so hard to maintain starts to crack.  \n#BravoTV #ShahsOfSunset\n\nGET MORE BRAVO:\nFollow Bravo: http://bravo.ly/Twitter\nLike Bravo: http://bravo.ly/Facebook\nFollow Bravo on Pinterest: https://www.pinterest.com/BravoTV\nBravo Instagram: http://bravo.ly/Instagram\nBravo Tumblr: http://bravo.ly/Tumblr\n\nBravo Media is the premiere lifestyle and entertainment brand that drives the cultural conversation around its high-quality, interactive original content that focuses on the network\u2019s passion points of food, fashion, beauty, design, digital and pop culture.

Meanwhile, GG is using the moon's energy to get pregnant.\n\n\u25ba\u25ba Subscribe for More: http://bravo.ly/Subscribe\n\u25ba\u25ba Visit the Official Site: http://bravo.ly/ Shahs of Sunset\n\u25ba\u25ba Watch Shahs of Sunset on Bravo!\n\nFOLLOW SHAHS OF SUNSET ON SOCIAL\nOfficial Site: http://bravo.ly/ShahsOfSunset\nFull Episodes & Clips: http://bravo.ly/ShahsOfSunsetVideos\nFacebook: http://bravo.ly/ShahsOfSunsetFacebook\n\nABOUT SHAHS OF SUNSET:\nReza finds himself at a crossroad in his personal life when he discovers that he and his husband Adam might not be on the same page about a major life decision. To add to this, as rumors questioning the stability of their relationship begin to swirl, Reza is shocked to find that his best friend of 30 years might be the one to blame for the hearsay and his journey to uncover the truth changes everything.\n\nAfter nearly losing her life delivering her baby boy, Shams, Mercedes is left feeling abandoned by her friends who she claims did not visit her in the hospital. When the offended Reza decides to air his grievances on social media and takes it too far, Mercedes\u2019 husband Tommy does the unthinkable.\n\nMike is on top of the world and convinced that he\u2019s found \u201cthe one\u201d in his Persian-Jewish girlfriend, Paulina. Looking to prove to his family that his former bad-boy ways are behind him, he pursues a potential multi-million-dollar real estate deal solo despite his parents\u2019 reluctance to step back. \n\nA more mature Golnesa is finally ready to transition into the next phase of her life, and she embarks on a journey to become a mother via IVF. When a health complication threatens to derail her dream, she attempts to manifest good karma with those around her \u2013 but it proves difficult as she continues to clash with Mercedes.   \n\nOn the surface, Destiney is thriving in every aspect of her life: a growing business, healthy personal life and solid plans for her future. As she struggles to cope with her mother and sister moving out-of-state, she finds herself embroiled in a series of questionable circumstances that threaten her friendships within the group. \n\nNewly-single Nema is ready to mingle but finds it difficult to let go of his past with former girlfriend \u2013 and current colleague \u2013 Erica. While his relationship with his parents remains an ongoing struggle, Nema attempts to help Reza and MJ confront their issues and inadvertently causes a rift of his own.  \n\nReza\u2019s friend Sara is new to the group and though she attempts stay above the fray, she struggles to find her footing amongst the rambunctious crew. When skeletons from her past and issues with her family come to light, the poised image she tries so hard to maintain starts to crack.  \n#BravoTV #ShahsOfSunset\n\nGET MORE BRAVO:\nFollow Bravo: http://bravo.ly/Twitter\nLike Bravo: http://bravo.ly/Facebook\nFollow Bravo on Pinterest: https://www.pinterest.com/BravoTV\nBravo Instagram: http://bravo.ly/Instagram\nBravo Tumblr: http://bravo.ly/Tumblr\n\nBravo Media is the premiere lifestyle and entertainment brand that drives the cultural conversation around its high-quality, interactive original content that focuses on the network\u2019s passion points of food, fashion, beauty, design, digital and pop culture.
