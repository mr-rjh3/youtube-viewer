Most people could tell immediately that he's a total lunatic spewing hot gibberish, but a shocking number of people were duped into thinking he's a genius. Joe wanted to get to the bottom of it all, so he decided to bring Terry back with someone more educated to do some fact checking. Disappointingly, he chose Eric Weinstein to do this, a pseudo-intellectual fraud who was only there to flex his intellect while simultaneously pretending Terry is on to something in order to scoop up some Terry fans for himself. While not exactly what needed to happen, it did result in some hilarious moments, so let's poke through for some highlights.\n\nMy previous video about Terry on Joe Rogan: \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u2022\u00a0Terrence\u00a0Howard\u00a0is\u00a0Legitimately\u00a0Insane\u00a0\u00a0\nWatch my other debunks/debates/discussions: http://bit.ly/ProfDaveDebunk\n\nEMAIL\u25ba ProfessorDaveExplains@gmail.com\nPATREON\u25ba \u00a0\u00a0/\u00a0professordaveexplains\u00a0\u00a0\n\nCheck out \"Is This Wi-Fi Organic?\", my book on disarming pseudoscience!\nAmazon: https://amzn.to/2HtNpVH\nBookshop: https://bit.ly/39cKADM\nBarnes and Noble: https://bit.ly/3pUjmrn\nBook Depository: http://bit.ly/3aOVDlT",

Jeff \"The Dude\" Lebowski doesn't want any drama in his life...heck, he can't even be bothered with a job. But, he must embark on a quest with his bowling buddies after his rug is destroyed in a twisted case of mistaken identity. Starring Jeff Bridges, John Goodman, Julianne Moore, Steve Buscemi, Philip Seymour Hoffman and John Turturro, experience the cultural phenomenon of The Dude in the \"#1 cult film of all time!\" (The Boston Globe).",
