        "description": "When you ask for a blend of retro/disco/hip hop, I guess this is what you get! And so that was a really nice surprise, quite unexpected I have to admit! That said, it is definitely not the first time that YG dabbles in retro sounds, but still I don't think I was imaging BAEMON to tackle such genre so quickly. They killed the raps, once again! Hate it or not, their rappers are gold! The vocals, as always, magical and I love the ad libs here! This got me thinking of a world cup song almost, but I think it's because of the more disco/retro approach of the song. I would say this is more of a grower than an instant hit for me though. The MV, I wished they pushed the whole 'Cinderella' concept a bit further because I'm a sucker for fairy tale retelling!
