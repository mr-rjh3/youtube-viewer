Become a Vox Member today: http://www.vox.com/memberships\n\nA key promise in Paris\u2019s bid to host the 2024 Summer Olympics was that its famous river, the Seine, would be cleaned up in time to host open water swimming events: the triathlon, para triathlon, and marathon swimming. But swimming has been banned in the Seine for a century because the Paris sewer system is designed to dump wastewater into the river during heavy rain, when the sewers get overwhelmed by stormwater. \n\nWhen that happens, levels of E. coli, a bacteria associated with fecal matter, spike in the river, making it too contaminated to swim in. In order to make good on its promise to clean the river, Paris officials took on a $1.5 billion USD infrastructure project that includes a massive underground tank and tunnel system meant to hold excess sewage during heavy rain and prevent further contamination of the Seine. \n\nWater quality testing will be done daily ahead of the Olympic games this summer, and Paris officials are hopeful their ambitious plan to host swimming in the famously polluted river will succeed. \n\nFollow the daily water quality tests of the Seine from the City of Paris here: \nhttps://www.paris.fr/pages/meteo-de-l...\n\nCheck out some of the data used in this video, along with additional water quality tests, from Fluidion:\nhttps://fluidion.com/open-data-initia...\n\nAre Olympians Going to Swim in Poop Water? \u2013 The Cut\nhttps://www.thecut.com/article/olympi...\n\nWill the Seine be ready for Olympic swimming?

        "description": "Thirty years ago, Taiwan immigrant Jensen Huang founded Nvidia with the dream of revolutionizing PCs and gaming with 3D graphics. In 1999, after laying off the majority of workers and nearly going bankrupt, the company succeeded when it launched what it claims as the world\u2019s first Graphics Processing Unit (GPU). Then Jensen bet the company on something entirely different: AI. Now, that bet is paying off in a big way as Nvidia\u2019s A100 chips quickly become the coveted training engines for ChatGPT and other generative AI. But as the chip shortage eases, other chip giants like Intel are struggling. And with all it\u2019s chips made by TSMC in Taiwan, Nvidia remains vulnerable to mounting U.S.-China trade tensions. We went to Nvidia\u2019s Silicon Valley, California, headquarters to talk with Huang and get a behind-the scenes-look at the chips powering gaming and the AI boom.\n\nChapters: \n02:04 \u2014 Chapter 1: Popularizing the GPU\n07:02 \u2014 Chapter 2: From graphics to AI and ChatGPT\n11:52 \u2014 Chapter 3: Geopolitics and other concerns\n14:31 \u2014 Chapter 4: Amazon, autonomous cars and beyond\n\nProduced and shot by: Katie Tarasov\nEdited by: Evan Lee Miller\nAdditional Camera: Andrew Evers\nSupervising Producer: Jeniece Pettitt\nGraphics by: Jason Reginato\n\n\u00bb Subscribe to CNBC: https://cnb.cx/SubscribeCNBC\n\u00bb Subscribe to CNBC TV: https://cnb.cx/SubscribeCNBCtelevision\n\u00bb Subscribe to CNBC Classic: https://cnb.cx/SubscribeCNBCclassic\n\nAbout CNBC: From 'Wall Street' to 'Main Street' to award winning original documentaries and Reality TV series, CNBC has you covered.

        "description": "\u2696\ufe0f Do you need a great lawyer?  I can help!  https://legaleagle.link/eagleteam \u2696\ufe0f\nThere are many ways to get into law school.  But I thought I\u2019d share my journey from undergrad to UCLA Law; everything from getting good grades in college, to taking the LSAT, to playing the waitlist game over the summer.  I call my story \"Legally Brunette.\"\n\nI knew from a young age that I wanted to be an attorney.  Seeing the dramatizations of trial lawyers on TV made me want to get into a courtroom myself.  So I did my best to get good grades throughout high school and college.  I studied hard and participated in mock trial.  \n\nWhen the time came, I studied the LSAT for months.  I studied the crap out of the strategies and tactics in order to get a good score on the LSAT.  A good LSAT score is the single most important thing you can do to get into law school.  \n\nEventually, I applied to the top 20 law schools in the country.  I was accepted into some, rejected by others, and waitlisted at a few.  But I got into the school of my choice (UCLA) and did pretty well (mostly A\u2019s).  I got the job of my dreams and am a practicing attorney to this day.\n\nIn my spare time, I teach current law students how to kick ass in law school.  \n\nHere\u2019s my prior video on the best major for law school: \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u2022\u00a0Best\u00a0Undergrad\u00a0Major\u00a0For\u00a0Law\u00a0School\u00a0(...\u00a0\u00a0\n\n========================================================\nGet our Ultimate Pre-Law Checklist (FREE) here \u279c https://www.legaleagleprep.com/prelaw   Learn learn how to get ready for law school, the 5 things you must do the summer before law school, and more . . .  \n========================================================\n\n\u2605 Got law school questions?

        "description": "\u2696\ufe0f Do you need a great lawyer?  I can help!  https://legaleagle.link/eagleteam \u2696\ufe0f\nGetting into law school is only half the battle.  This is my story of how I learned to succeed in law school in the face of stiff competition, crazy professors, and endless work.  \n\nLaw school is incredibly intimidating.  When you arrive you are surrounded by the highest concentration of the smartest people you\u2019ll ever meet.  It\u2019s very different from college where many people are just skating by.  In law school, everyone is giving 100% and going 100 miles per hour.  \n\nLaw school is graded on a curve.  Which means that professors can only give out a few A\u2019s per class, no matter how well everyone does on the exams.  Generally only the top 5% get A\u2019s and another 5-10% get A minuses.  You\u2019re not competing against the professor\u2019s exam, you are competing against your fellow classmates.  \n\nI realized pretty quickly that I couldn\u2019t out work my classmates.  I also couldn\u2019t \u201cout think\u201d them in the sense of just being smarter.  I was going to have to find an edge.  \n\nSo I started to study law school itself.  I learned all the tricks.  I learned to focus on what matters and remove all the extraneous stuff.  So much of law school is wasted on focusing on crap that doesn\u2019t matter.  I learned to work smarter rather than harder.  \n\nIn the end, my strategic thinking paid off.  Watch the video until the end to find out how.  \n\nIf you\u2019re interested in learning the system that I created (one that is guaranteed to get you better grades in law school) you can check out the link below.  In my spare time, I teach current law students how to kick ass in law school.  I\u2019m not special.  I just systematized a better way.  And you can get that system.

        "description": "\u2696\ufe0f Do you need a great lawyer?  I can help!  https://legaleagle.link/eagleteam \u2696\ufe0f\nThere is one thing about law school that I hate.  One thing that is a total bait and switch.  \n\nFor an institution that is famous for rigorous academic debate, extreme amounts of homework, and unending studying, very few of those things matter.  Your grade in law school is generally based on one thing, and one thing alone: your final exam.  \n\nThat wouldn't be so bad, I suppose, except that your final exam looks nothing like the rest of your entire school year.  Your final is usually based on an issue spotting hypothetical that prizes application of the law about mere knowledge.\n\nI actually think the \"issue spotting\" exam is great.  It is a reasonably good test of lawyer-like analysis.  The problem is that no one teaches you how to do it.  And professors don't tell students that class participation won't help on the exam.  Students don't find out until it's too late.  \n\nWell, I'm here to tell you that you need to start preparing for this idiosyncratic test now.  You CAN learn how to do issue spotting exams.  You CAN get better.  Good grades are possible if you know what to look for.  \n\nIf you\u2019re interested in learning the system that I created (one that is guaranteed to get you better grades in law school) you can check out the link below.  In my spare time, I teach current law students how to kick ass in law school.  I\u2019m not special.  I just systematized a better way.  And you can get that system.

It will change the way you read your casebook.  \n\nCase briefs.  Ugh. \n\nCase briefs are the worst.  \n\nEven if you went on a six month vacation after taking the LSAT, you\u2019ve probably heard about case briefs.  You\u2019ve probably heard horror stories about student\u2019s reading cases non-stop and preparing their case briefs for hours before class starts.\n\nThose stories are probably true.  \n\nBut if you haven\u2019t purchased your casebooks yet and you haven\u2019t started classes, you might be wondering: WHAT THE HELL IS A CASE BRIEF?\n\nI get that question a lot so I decided to make the definitive explainer about case briefs.  \n\nIn this video you\u2019ll learn everything about case briefs: \n\nWhy casebriefs suck\nWhy they take so much time\nHow you can get around them\n\nAlso, be sure to use our Flipped Case Method.

        "description": "\u2696\ufe0f Do you need a great lawyer?  I can help!  https://legaleagle.link/eagleteam \u2696\ufe0f\nIt seems like I've been talking a lot about how expensive law school is.  \n\nSo it's natural for students to want to reduce those costs.  One way is to get scholarships aka free money.  \n\nFree money is great.  In fact, free money is my favorite kind of money.  But that's not an option for some law students. \n\nSo one option that students often ask me about is working during law school.  \n\nThe allure is obvious: make a little money to defray the cost of school (or to make a little spending money).  Getting a job doesn't require financial need.  Nor does it require special academic performance.  \n\nSo a job could open up some opportunities that might not be available in the context of scholarships.  \n\nMore money is always good, so what could go wrong?\n\nA lot can go wrong.  \n\nI recorded a video that talks about how much can go wrong if you prioritize the wrong things in law school, second job included.  \n\nGetting a job while being a full time law student is being penny-wise and pound-foolish.\n\n========================================================\nGet our Ultimate Pre-Law Checklist (FREE) here \u279c https://www.legaleagleprep.com/prelaw   Learn learn how to get ready for law school, the 5 things you must do the summer before law school, and more . . .  \n========================================================\n\n\u2605 Got law school questions?

And almost as important, which ones will help your resume when it comes time to apply for 1L jobs?\n\nLaw Review:  Law reviews publish lengthy, comprehensive treatments of subjects (\"articles\"), generally written by law professors, judges, or legal practitioners, as well as shorter pieces, commonly called \"notes\" and \"comments,\" written by law student \"members\" of the law review.\nLaw review articles often express the thinking of specialists or experts with regard to problems with current law and potential solutions to those problems.  In the United States, law reviews are typically edited by a certain percentage of the top students in the class or students who are selected to join after successfully completing a \u201cwrite on competition\u201d at the end of their first year of law school.\n\nMoot Court:  Moot court involves a simulated appellate court (appellate advocacy). Moot court does not involve actual testimony by witnesses, cross-examination, or the presentation of evidence, but is focused solely on the application of the law to a common set of evidentiary assumptions, facts, and clarifications/corrections to which the competitors are introduced.  Participants usually draft memoranda and conduct oral argument.\n\nMock Trial:  Mock trial is usually a student run competition in law school.  It is similar to a moot court, but mock trials simulate lower-court trials, while moot court simulates appellate court hearings.  Students participate in rehearsed trials to learn about the legal system in a competitive manner. Students portray the attorneys and usually the witnesses as well.  Mock trial is often taught in conjunction with a course in Trial Advocacy.\n\nDrinking:  There is a lot of drinking in law school.... Just be warned that when someone talks about going to \u201cbar review\u201d on Thursday night at 9pm, they aren\u2019t preparing for the state bar.  They are prepare for a different bar...\n\nStudent Groups: There are lots of student groups in law school.  Odds are, if you are passionate about a cause there is a student group in law school that wants the same thing.  \n\nSocial Committees: Social committees try to bring some life into law school.  They help organize the law prom, musical, and other get-togethers.  It\u2019s good for your soul!\n\n========================================================\nIf you want to learn to THINK LIKE A LAWYER and ACE YOUR NEXT EXAM, check out our LAW SCHOOL MASTERCLASS at https://www.legaleagleprep.com/master...\n========================================================\n\n\u2605 Got law school questions?

You're thrown into a situation that you've never been in before. You're learning about subjects that you didn't know existed.  It's probably going over your head. You probably feel stressed out, you might be a little freaked out, that's okay, everyone feels that way. But let's talk about all the dos and don'ts of your first week of law school. Everything you can do to maximize your chances of success later on and everything you can do to minimize your stress in the present.\n\n\u2605 You should understand that the way that law school is taught is completely backwards. You learn the most antiquated arcane cases early on in the semester and there is very little chance that any of those cases will be used on the final exam.\n\n\u2605 The second thing to realize is that a lot of the information that your school is going to give you is bad.\n\n\u2605 Don\u2019t try to do everything.\n\n\u2605 Start outlining.\n\n\u2605 Learn to write an issue spotting exam and spot all the issues.  \n\n\nGet More Great Tips - Subscribe \u279c https://goo.gl/JwQUPf",

Martha Barnard-Rae writes clear, convincing words for exacting humans. As a copywriter and owner of Word Candy, she specialises in personality and values-driven SEO copywriting for outside-the-box brands. Martha\u2019s words live on the websites, blogs, videos, and emails of businesses all over Australia. \n\nAs a card-carrying Millennial, her career has evolved. But English teaching, corporate training, and copywriting are rooted in clear, engaging communication. Martha is a communicator through and through \u2014 and has always had a deep respect for the power of words. \n\nThis Canadian transplant is a life-long sun chaser. A voracious reader. An extroverted-extrovert with a penchant for social justice chats. She\u2019s wife to a darling husband, mum to two lovely boys \u2014 and a sore loser of board games.\n\nWhen Martha\u2019s not crafting delicious words, you\u2019ll find her walking two giant pooches, obsessing over her latest hobby, or wrapped around a cup of tea, planning her next Instagram reel.

They feel ashamed because they believe the people around them who say they\u2019re lazy, have a serious character flaw, or\u2014at best\u2014are quirky. They don\u2019t realize that adult ADHD doesn\u2019t look like ADHD in kids, and remaining undiagnosed can make them feel anxious, overwhelmed, and powerless. \n\nSpeaker Heather Brannon, MD, draws on 14 years of experience treating adult ADHD. A family physician who has been practicing for nearly 30 years, she realized that many patients who felt overwhelmed, anxious, easily frustrated, and tired actually had ADHD and that diagnosing it correctly and treating it was life-changing for those patients. She decided in 2014 to devote her entire practice to adolescents and adults with ADHD. \n\n----\nThis presentation debuted during TEDxHeritageGreen 2021: TRUTH, held in three short virtual sessions on April 23, 25, and 27\u2014visit https://www.tedxheritagegreen.com for more info.

She decided in 2014 to devote her entire practice, Greenville ADHD Specialists, to adolescents and adults with ADHD. Heather completed her internship and residency at Womack Army Medical Center in Fort Bragg, NC, and has served as a staff physician in a combat support hospital, behavioral science curriculum coordinator, medical director of a family practice residency clinic, and chief of staff of a community hospital.

        "description": "For most people it's not a matter of if, but when, they will lose some sense of hearing. Still, we don't give hearing loss or hearing aids much thought until it happens to us--or someone we know. \n\nOnly then do we learn that hearing aids are incapable of restoring hearing to normal, especially in acoustically challenging situations. The good news is that modern technology continues to bring us new, sometimes hidden, and often unknown features that can help those with hearing loss overcome more of their hearing challenges.\n\nJuli\u00ebtte Sterkens, AuD, is an audiologist with forty years of experience in hearing rehabilitation turned consumer advocate with the Hearing Loss Association of America. She has published numerous articles and lectured internationally to consumers,  audiologists, hearing instrument specialists, and venue operators. Topics include living well with hearing loss, hearing accessibility, and hearing loops. Her work has led to hundreds of hearing loop installations in Wisconsin. She has received numerous awards for her efforts, including the American Academy of Audiology Presidential Award. She serves on the board of HEAR in the Fox Cities, a non-profit that helps pay for hearing aids for children in North-East Wisconsin.\n\nShe enjoys gardening, traveling worldwide to observe solar eclipses with her husband, and visiting her family and son in the Netherlands and daughter in Australia.

        "description": "World-renowned relationship expert John Gottman set forth to understand why relationships don\u2019t work, but for that he needed to first understand relationships scientifically. Gottman then measured the behavior, perception and physiology of couples over time to understand how love works. With that he was able to create equations for love and discern the mathematical dynamics of love. His science was able to predict with a 90% accuracy whether relationships would last or not. Finally, his studies conclude that the magic of love requires calm and commitment, which in the end makes the magic of great love a bit less of a mystery. \n\nJohn Gottman speaks about how his scientific research has now created a new understanding of all love relationships (heterosexual and same-sex), across the entire life span. He describes the new LOVE EQUATIONS, and the magic trio of calm, trust, and commitment. For more, visit The Gottman Institute at https://www.gottman.com/.  World-renowned for his work on marital stability and divorce prediction, Dr. John Gottman has conducted 40 years of breakthrough research with thousands of couples. He is the author of over 200 published academic articles and author or co-author of more than 40 books, including The New York Times bestseller The Seven Principles for Making Marriage Work. \n\nDr. Gottman\u2019s media appearances include Good Morning America, Today, CBS Morning News, and Oprah, as well articles in The New York Times, Redbook, Glamour, Woman\u2019s Day, People, Self, and Psychology Today. Co-founder of The Gottman Institute with his wife, Dr. Julie Schwartz Gottman, John is a Professor Emeritus of Psychology at the University of Washington where he founded \u201dThe Love Lab\" at which much of his research on couples interactions was conducted.

        "description": "Attorney Marilyn York owns a Men\u2019s Rights Family Law Firm in Reno Nevada, established in 2001. She and her ten female employees focus on representing men for two reasons: 1. As her talk explains, fathers are crucial in the upbringing and development of their children; and 2. Fathers are the disadvantaged parent in family court and society and while the laws are improving, the statistics are not. There are currently more than 17,000,000 children growing up in America without their fathers and every year this number is growing. According to the Center for Disease Control, children from fatherless homes account for 90% of homeless and runaway children; 71% of high school dropouts and 63% of youth suicides. Listen to this talk to find out how you can help America's 17,000,000 fatherless children avoid these fates!  Marilyn D. York is a Men's Rights Divorce Attorney, licensed in California since 1998 and Nevada since 1999, where she is a Certified Family Law Specialist. Since 2001, Marilyn has owned her law firm in Reno, Nevada, where she and her 9 female employees specifically represent men in divorce and family law battles. Marilyn chose her career because of her passion for children and relationships but most of all, Marilyn is driven to help underdogs. While the laws are improving for men, not all laws are yet gender equal and the interpretation and enforcement of those that are, have a long way to go. Despite her focus on representing men, Marilyn has a deep compassion for women in need as well. It isn't lost on Marilyn that women remain disadvantaged outside Family Court. She serves that need as Board President for a local housing program for homeless young women, Nevada Youth Empowerment Project, or NYEP.

Jaye is known for tackling complex and often controversial subject matters. Her latest film is  The Red Pill. Prior to  \u201cThe Red Pill\u201d, Jaye\u2019s most notable films were  the award winning feature documentaries \u201cDaddy I Do\u201d (which examined the Abstinence-Only Movement versus Comprehensive Sex Education) and \u201cThe Right to Love: An American Family\u201d (which followed one family\u2019s activism fighting for same-sex marriage rights in California). Both films showed that Jaye\u2019s interview style is to allow people to share their views honestly, openly and candidly while allowing audiences to come to  their own conclusions.\nhttp://theredpillmovie.com/about-the-...\n\n~~\n\nThis talk was given at a TEDx event using the TED conference format but independently organized by a local community.

It\u2019s now the biggest killer of men under 45 in the UK with 12 men taking their own lives every day.\n\nIn her challenging TEDx talk, Steph Slack shares her personal story of how losing her uncle to suicide caused her to question how we react to men who experience suicidal thoughts.    \n\nSteph asks: what if we stop seeing having suicidal thoughts as something unusual, change our stereotypical expectations of men and instead, support men who have the courage to be vulnerable with us?\n\nWhat would happen if we all went home and had conversations with the men in our lives about what they\u2019re feeling and thinking? The answer to solving today\u2019s male suicide crisis may be simply listening to the men in our lives.\n\nIf you are experiencing suicidal thoughts or are in crisis, in the UK Samaritans operate a 24/7 helpline on 116 123 or CALM operate a helpline 5pm to midnight for men on 0800 585858. \n\n*all those who identify as male.\n\nHer portfolio of work focuses on three areas: the workplace (as an independent speaker and consultant advising on CR, D&I and wellbeing with a particular focus on mens' mental health and suicide awareness); schools (as Director of Who In The Zoo - a social enterprise producing a new classroom tool to help children understand and communicate their emotions); and the community (as a speaker and writer on mental health and male suicide prevention).
