Then suddenly Pokey's brother Liam appears to save him moments before his execution, they travel through space and time together captuing Elephants and eating Pumpkins. Truly this is an emotional ride until out of nowhere a giant Ape appears and eats Liam. Pokey must avenge his brother by chasing this Ape back to his Ape house where his Ape kids lived. Pokey realises that even Apes have brothers, so he chooses not to attack the Ape and accepts that sometimes Apes get hungry.\n\n\nVote the next character essay on: \u00a0\u00a0/\u00a0implicitlypretentious\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n Arcadia - Wonders by Kevin MacLeod is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution license (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/...)\nSource: http://incompetech.com/music/royalty-...\nArtist: http://incompetech.com/",

This story is followed by the prequel called Iron Man 3 which is set directly after the Winter Soldier, in this installment, an army of lizard people called Snake Men declares war on the Guinea Men and after 3 days of war called the \u201c3 Days of War\u201d, the conflict was interrupted by Sportacus from Lazy Town who settled the dispute with apples. This leads into the final chapter called Avengers Age of Ultron where Optimus Prime must stop the Decepticons from stealing his credit card details with the help of Wheeljack and Ratchet. Unfortunately Optimus discovers he's voiced by Sean Bean and is subsequently gunned down by Megatron when Hot Rod tried to intervene.\n\nSusanDoodles (my banner artist): \u00a0\u00a0/\u00a0susansdoodles\u00a0\u00a0 \n\nPatreon for anyone who doesn't want me to just eat boiled rice all day:  \u00a0\u00a0/\u00a0implicitlypretentious\u00a0\u00a0\n\nGreen Monday by Twin Musicom is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution license (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/...)\nArtist: http://www.twinmusicom.org/",
