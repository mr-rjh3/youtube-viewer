Yellen, Secretary of the Treasury\n\n___________________________________\n\n\nBackground\n\nThe Secretary of the Treasury is required by law to testify each year before the Financial Services Committee on the international financial system, with a particular focus on the following four areas:\n\n1) progress made in reforming the International Monetary Fund (IMF);\n2) the status of efforts to reform the international financial system;\n3) the compliance of countries that have received assistance from the IMF with agreements they entered into as a condition for receiving IMF assistance; and\n4) the status of implementation of international anti-money laundering and counterterrorist financing standards by the IMF, the multilateral development banks, and other multilateral financial policymaking bodies.\n\nOrigins and Operations of the IMF\n\nThe International Monetary Fund\u2019s (IMF\u2019s) primary mission is to promote international macroeconomic stability. The IMF traces its roots to a July 1944 meeting at Bretton Woods, New Hampshire, where representatives from 45 nations gathered to discuss the postwar recovery of Europe. The discussions included the creation of international institutions to resolve some of the problems\u2014such as protectionist trade policies and unstable exchange rates\u2014that hobbled the international economy between the two world wars. Two other international organizations also trace their origins to the Bretton Woods conference: the World Bank and the World Trade Organization. The World Bank\u2019s mission is to reduce poverty and facilitate economic development. The World Trade Organization seeks to liberalize international trade and oversees the rules governing the international trade system. The IMF came into formal existence in 1945 and has grown to near-global membership of 190 countries today.\n\nLike the global financial system, the IMF has evolved during its seven decades. Until the early 1970s, the IMF\u2019s primary purpose was to manage the system of fixed exchange rates agreed to at Bretton Woods. The U.S. dollar was initially fixed to gold at $35 per ounce. All other member countries\u2019 currencies were fixed to the dollar at different rates. The IMF monitored the macroeconomic and exchange rate policies of its member countries and helped them weather economic crises by providing them with short-term loans. This global system of fixed exchange rates was disrupted in 1973 when the United States went off the gold standard. After a period of instability, the modern system of floating exchange rates came into effect. The IMF adapted to the new system of floating exchange rates by promoting stable exchange rates and continued to provide temporary financing to countries affected by economic crises.\n\nThe IMF\u2019s current operations can be grouped into three categories: surveillance, lending, and technical assistance:\n\n\u2022 Surveillance: The IMF monitors the economic and financial policies of its member countries to identify possible risks to financial stability and offer advice on policy adjustments.\n\n\u2022 Lending: The IMF lends to countries facing balance-of-payments problems, which generally means they are having trouble paying for imports or servicing their debt. The IMF provides temporary financial assistance to help these countries stabilize their economies while implementing economic reforms. The IMF disburses its loans in phases (\u201ctranches\u201d) after verifying that specified economic conditions and reforms have been met (\u201cconditionality\u201d).\n\n\u2022 Technical Assistance: The IMF provides technical assistance and training to help its member countries strengthen their capacity to design and implement effective policies. The IMF providestechnical assistance in monetary and financial policies; fiscal policy and management; statistical data compilation; and economic and financial legislation. A small but important component of technical assistance also targets countries\u2019 ability to combat money laundering and terrorism financing.\n\nU.S. policy at the IMF is made by the Executive Branch and Congress. Within the Executive Branch, the Treasury Department has primary responsibility for managing U.S. participation in the IMF. The President appoints U.S. representatives to the IMF Board of Governors and IMF Board of Executive Directors...\n\n\nHearing page: https://democrats-financialservices.h...",

Completed in 1941 by sculptor Gutzon Borglum and his son Lincoln, the sculpture's roughly 60-foot-high granite faces depict U.S. presidents George Washington, Thomas Jefferson, Theodore Roosevelt, and Abraham Lincoln.\n\nThe carving of Mount Rushmore was a massive undertaking. It took 14 years to complete, and involved the use of dynamite and other explosives to remove over 450,000 tons of rock.",

Since 1976 the national park has also been designated as a UNESCO biosphere reserve. In 1981 UNESCO declared it a World Heritage Site. Since the national park is located on a remote peninsula, some animal and plant species have developed here that can only be found here in the park. For this reason, the park is a popular research area for biologists and zoologists.\n\nThe national park consists of two separate parts. The coastline is very rugged and often shrouded in fog. Inland, the forest connects directly to the beaches, which often leads to fallen tree trunks lying across the beach. The core area of \u200b\u200bthe park is the mountainous region around the Olympic Mountains, which is covered by many ancient glaciers. To the west of it are temperate rainforest up to the park boundary, here lies the wettest point in the contiguous United States.\n\n\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\r\n\r\nSubscribe Free Documentary - Nature Channel for free: http://bit.ly/2mFDC3Q\r\nFacebook: https://bit.ly/2QfRxbG\r\nTwitter: https://bit.ly/2QlwRiI\r\n\r\n\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\r\n#FreeDocumentaryNature #Documentary #Cascadia\r\n\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\n\r\nFree Documentary is dedicated to bring high-class documentaries to you on youtube for free.

        "description": "Are you tired of outdated, non-scientific methods in sensory evaluation? Discover how cutting-edge sensory science can revolutionize your understanding of sensory evaluation as well as consumer preferences and how to connect the two.\r\n\r\nAfter many years of teaching and training, CoffeeMind has a clear picture of the sensory evaluation techniques out there and what works and what doesn't work (but keeps being practised), and we will present our view of this in this lecture where we will dive deep into the strange fact that both the wider coffee community as well as a lot of actual scientists are confused which means that they create and interpret sensory data in a directly wrong and non-scientific way!\r\n\r\nWhat You\u2019ll Learn:\r\n1. The Essence of Scientific Data and Evidence\r\nUnderstand the foundation of scientific data and what makes them objective rather than subjective (and why correctly collected sensory data are OBJECTIVE!)\r\nLearn how to distinguish credible scientific evidence from mere conjecture.\r\n2. Sensory Science Unveiled\r\nExplore the Pangborn Sensory Science Trust\u2019s Three-Stage Gate Model.\r\nDelve into Discriminative, Descriptive, and Hedonic investigations to get a holistic understanding of sensory analysis.\r\n3. Clearing the Confusion\r\nIdentify and rectify common misconceptions about sensory data that perplex even seasoned professionals.\r\nGain clarity on how to properly interpret sensory findings.\r\n4. Publications to Avoid\r\nGet an insightful critique of certain scientific publications that fall short of standards and should be approached cautiously (actually, they should never have been published in the first place).\r\n5. What the Tooth Fairy and 'quality' data has in common\r\nLearn the pitfalls of pseudo-scientific approaches and how to avoid them.\r\nLearn about the 'ontological status' of data in general and how this applies to sensory data.\r\n6. CoffeeMinds Sensory Training\r\nExperience a scientific approach to sensory education that has been driven by Ida Steen in her industrial PhD about sensory learning in CoffeeMind, which was work we started almost a decade ago.\r\nLearn from real-world applications and truly scientific training methodologies that are proven to work.\r\nAbout the Presenter: Morten M\u00fcncow\r\n\r\nMorten M\u00fcncow is the driving force behind CoffeeMind and has, together with his colleague Ida Steen, been investigating and practising a scientific approach to sensory education for more than a decade. With years of experience developing sensory training programs, Morten and Ida integrate rigorous scientific principles into practical training for professionals. Their deep understanding of sensory science is rooted in his extensive research and his role in advancing the methodologies used in sensory evaluation.\r\n\r\nCoffeeMind is renowned for its scientifically robust approach to sensory training. It offers comprehensive programs that equip individuals with the skills needed to excel in sensory analysis.\r\n\r\nThis event is a must for anyone involved in sensory evaluation, product development, or consumer research.

        "description": "As a consultant and trainer, I\u2019m constantly confronted with the concept of Rate of Rise as a superior reference point for improving roast profiles. With our scientific background and strong commitment to only use concepts that are explicitly helpful for coffee roasters to create successful products for customers we have to speak up about the misleading nature of how Rate of Rise often is obsessed by by students all over the world. It is the single most discussed concept that I have to handle during all my courses and dismantle in my students minds before we can get to the userful concepts that actually makes a difference in their lives and are actionable from a business strategic perspective. The content of this blogpost is the result of discussion this with hundreds and hundreds of students and clients so I think it is relevant and useful to make a separate blogpost about it even though it was also dealt with from many different angles in our podcast series about Coffee Science.  It will show you how our thoughts are not just \u2018our opinion\u2019 but deeply embedded in the scientific tradition all the way back to Plato and through the centuries of refinement and improvement of scientific thinking! Where the science podcast series was structured from the point of view of science this article is a good example of how science can be used practically on a single technical subject that has caused quite a lot of confusion. This article is a condensation of the approach I have when the subject of Rate of Rise is discussed during courses and consultancy sessions. To save time and get this subject over with before these sessions we will systematically refer students and clients to this podcast before the event.",

The lecture is entitled \"Thematic analysis: What is it, when is it useful, and what does 'best practice' look like?\" In this hour lecture, Victoria Clarke maps out different approaches to thematic analysis, and different conceptualisations of the 'theme', addresses common misconceptions and confusions about thematic analysis, and highlights the flexibility thematic analysis offers the qualitative researcher. Victoria Clarke is co-author with Virginia Braun of the highly cited paper 'Using Thematic Analysis in Psychology' (2006), and is widely regarded as a leading authority on thematic analysis.",
