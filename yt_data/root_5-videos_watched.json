It has the only V12 in a series production car from Japan, and has some of the best paint on any car ever - seven layers of it! Also, up until recently the V12 Century was only ever driven outside of Japan by high-ranking diplomats and ambassadors. \n\nBut for James this car is now even more special. He has purchased it from Eclection Auto in Vaughan and is currently using it as a companion to his own beloved Miata. It has quiet and comfortable wool trimmed seats, a buttery smooth ride that could make even a certain British manufacturer blush, and loads of early 2000\u2019s Japanese tech. But let\u2019s see what made James fall in love with this Toyota Century and hear what Thomas has to say about the purchase. We hope you enjoy the episode. Thanks for watching!

What is the best 3 car garage you could buy for under $50,000 combined? The rules are, you must pick a daily, a classic, and a sports car listed on AutoTempest, all while staying within the $50,000 budget. Thomas and James take rather different approaches to this challenge, so grab a hot cuppa and get cozy. We hope you enjoy the episode.

The Gray Ghost haunted the field it drove on, moving at almost spiritual speeds as it tracked down other unsuspecting cars in its way.\n\nWaddell Wilson was the one who built the car for Buddy Baker during his time at Rainer Racing. To this day, the car still holds the fastest time to run a Daytona 500 ever. This is Dale Earnhardt Jr.'s favorite paint scheme on a car ever, and it may just be your favorite after you listen to the stories from the Pioneer of Speed.\n\nFollow Dirty Mo Media\nFacebook: \u00a0\u00a0/\u00a0dirtymomedia\u00a0\u00a0\nTwitter: \u00a0\u00a0/\u00a0dirtymomedia\u00a0\u00a0\nInstagram: \u00a0\u00a0/\u00a0dirtymomedia\u00a0\u00a0\nTikTok: \u00a0\u00a0/\u00a0dirtymomedia_\u00a0\u00a0\n\nAll About Dirty Mo Media: https://www.dirtymomedia.com",

        "description": "We were just trying to do something good, when some power tripping customs agents who were apparently bored that day decided to throw everything they could at me.  Even though both agents had completely different ideas of what these chairs were classified as, and what laws I broke by trying to bring them in to the country, both were adamant about the fact that THEY were right.  After a very long detainment and a story that I will tell in full once this all blows over, it was made very clear that if I tried to bring these chairs into the country again I would be arrested on the spot.\n\nI have to say a huge thank you to \u202a@BruceCookfmx\u202c for doing everything he could on his end to get the situation worked out, Chase Barber from \u202a@EdisonMotors\u202c for offering to hop in his pickup and drive down to the border on the spot to argue on my behalf and try to come up with a solution, and the cyber security company Aura for offering to sponsor this video in support of the project.   Even though I'm not going to charge them for the sponsorship because I didn't do what I told them I would do for the video, you can still get a 2 week free trial by clicking on the link here!\n https://aura.com/caseyladelle\n\nBe sure to check out our Patreon project where we use whatever it brings in in a month as our budget to help someone the following month!

Well, it's Lexus-speak for a soft riding luxury SUV with high fuel economy and the added luxury of visiting a gas station as infrequently as you'd like, ans that's all because of the +. In a nutshell what Lexus did is snag the 300+ horsepower plug in hybrid system from the RAV4 prime and jam it under the hood of the mid-size Lexus SUV and the combo is quite simply the best RX around. Despite the power ratings and the numbers, the plug in hybrid RX is just as fast and handles just as well as the RX 500h F-Sport but the engine and transmission are smoother and quieter and the fuel economy is at least 10 MPG better. So why have the RX 500? Honestly, I'm not sure. \n\nJoin this channel to get access to perks! \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0/\u00a0@aautobuyersguide\u00a0\u00a0\nBuy Merch! http://aoamerch.com\n\nThe Pod: \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0/\u00a0autobuyersguidepodcast\u00a0\u00a0\nEV Buyers Guide: \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0/\u00a0evbuyersguide\u00a0\u00a0\nThe Mountain Garden: \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0/\u00a0themountaingarden\u00a0\u00a0\n\nFollow us on Facebook: http://fb.me/theautobuyersguide/",

Is it worth the money over the #lexusnx 450h? or the #rav4prime ?\n\nRX-first Plug-in Hybrid Electric Vehicle\nEPA-estimated combined 83 MPGe rating\nStandard Luxury grade\nAvailable Traffic Jam Assist*\nStarting MSRP of $70,080 (includes Delivery, Processing and Handling Fee)\nAvailable by the end of 2023\n\nRX-First Plug-In Hybrid Powertrain\n\nPowered by a high-capacity lithium-ion battery paired with a 2.5-liter inline 4-cylinder engine (shared with NX), the 2024 RX 450h+ hybrid system has a manufacturer-estimated combined 83 MPGe rating. The system provides luxury performance and consistent acceleration off the line with an estimated 6.2 second 0-60 time. The RX 450h+ has an EPA-estimated 37-mile driving range rating on electric power only.\n\nThe RX450h+ comes equipped with a Level 1 vehicle-charging cable for 120V outlets and all models are equipped with a J1772 (Type 1) socket for at-home and public charging. A high-output, high-efficiency system designed to reduce power loss when converting from AC power to DC power results in faster charging times. Using the maximum charging current of 240V and under ideal conditions, the Lexus RX 450h+ can be fully charged in approximately two-and-a-half hours using the standard 6.6 kW Onboard Charger.\n\nThe RX 450h+ utilizes an electronically controlled, full-time AWD system for a confident, sporty driving experience, led by Lexus Driving Signature vehicle fundamentals. Optimizing front and rear torque distribution according to the driving conditions, the driver can control the vehicle as preferred throughout varied road conditions and driving styles.\n\nAs the first luxury brand to offer a hybrid in the segment, it\u2019s only fitting that RX offers a variety of electrified powertrains. Building on the all-new redesign of the iconic crossover vehicle last year, Lexus adds the much-anticipated plug-in hybrid to the electrified lineup. The 2024 Lexus RX 450h+ offers standard luxury elements, intuitive technology, and thoughtful in-cabin features.\n\n00:00 - 450h+ Powertrain\n01:30 - Exterior Walkaround\n03:10 - Cargo\n03:41 - Backseat\n06:00 - Frontseat\n11:43 - Driving Impressions\n19:23 - Final Thoughts",

        "description": "The 10 BEST Midsize SUVs in 2024!\n\nLooking for the perfect midsize SUV? We've got you covered! From the affordable to the luxurious, from the rugged to the refined, from the family hauler to the sporty cruiser, we\u2019ve rounded up the best of 2024.  \n\nIn no particular order\u2026\n\nHonda Passport - best value \n\nHonda Passport is probably one of the most versatile midsize SUVs in the market at the moment. It made many top ranking lists for its athletic prowess, generous space and nice exceptional standard features. \n\nA 3.5-liter V6 engine delivers 280 horsepower and 262 lb-ft of torque, paired with a nine-speed automatic transmission and standard all-wheel drive. A 0-60 mph run would take about 6.8 seconds, which is among the quickest in its price range. \n\nPair the punchy acceleration with a solid all-wheel drive system and you\u2019ve got a very strong performer, which can handle dirt, snow or just about any weather, like a champ. More than that, you can tow up to 5,000 pounds with it when you need it. \n\nInside, the Passport is very spacious and comfortable. The front wide seats provide good support, and the reclining rear seats are also a nice touch. The cabin is very quiet overall, with very little wind and tire noise making their way inside. \n\nThe 8-inch infotainment screen responds quickly to pinch and swipe gestures for easy map zoom and rotation. Apple CarPlay and Android auto are standard, as most of the modern technology features you\u2019d want. \n\nIn terms of fuel economy, the EPA estimates 21 mpg combined for the AWD Passport, which is kinda\u2019 middle ground for a midsize SUV. Tests show that the real-world mpg are in line with the EPA estimates, which is great. \n\nThe starting price is good for a family midsize SUV, and the exceptional materials, spacious interior and punchy performance will make it feel like a bargain. \n\nThe basic EX-L trim offers 20-inch alloy wheels, power liftgate, a sunroof, three-zone automatic climate control, heated and power-adjustable front seats with memory settings for the driver\u2019s seat, remote engine start, wireless smartphone charging and a seven-speaker audio system. \n\nMoreover, every Passport comes with blind-spot warning with rear cross-traffic warning, forward collision mitigation, lane keeping assist, adaptive cruise control and parking sensors. \n\nIt\u2019s really a very long list of standard features which makes the Passport one of the best midsize SUVs for the money. \n\n\nJeep Grand Cherokee - best towing\n\nGenuine off-road capabilities - that\u2019s the best way we could describe the Grand Cherokee. Add a relatively spacious interior, and class-leading towing capabilities to it, and you\u2019ve got one of the best SUVs Jeep has made in a while. \n\nEngine-wise, you\u2019ve got a choice of V6, V8 and even a plug-in hybrid, which can drive about 25 miles on all-electric power and generate a maximum of 375 horsepower and 470 lb-ft of torque, more than the Grand Cherokee\u2019s V8. \n\nAs standard, the Grand Cherokee comes with a 3.6-liter V6 making 293 horsepower and 260 lb-ft of torque). The V8 is a 5.7-liter monster putting out 357 hp and 390 lb-ft of torque, available on the Overland and Summit trim levels. It can cover 0-60 mph in under 6.5 seconds. That\u2019s the quickest in its class and price range. \n\nAll the powertrains send the power to the wheels through an 8-speed automatic transmission. The V6 models come standard with rear-wheel drive, while four-wheel drive is available. The V8 and the plug-in hybrid are 4WD exclusive. \n\nOnce you step inside the cabin, the Grand Cherokee will surprise you with very comfortable front and rear seats which can be equipped with heating and ventilation. The optional air suspension will make every ride feel like a blessing and the available four-zone climate control does its job well. \n\nPassengers up to 6 feet tall can lounge comfortably in the reclining second row, while enjoying the wonderful distortion-free sound quality coming from the optional 19-speaker McIntosh surround-sound system. \n\nSmartphone integration is standard, and you can get up to 12 USB ports inside. You\u2019ll also have plenty of space to store small items. \n\nThe Grand Cherokee is one step ahead of its rivals when it comes to towing, as well. The V6 can tow up to 6,200 pounds, while the V8 can pull 7,200 pounds. \n\n#bestmidsizeSUV #2024 #suv",

This 2024 Hyundai Santa Fe hybrid is powered by a 1.6L turbocharged 4-cylinder with a 6-speed automatic transmission, a combined 231 horsepower and 271 lb-ft. of torque. In Canada, standard AWD. In the US, FWD and AWD options are available. You can put regular fuel in the 2024 Hyundai Santa Fe hybrid.\nYou want an affordable 3-row hybrid? You\u2019ve got it right here! In Canada, the 2024 Hyundai Santa Fe hybrid Preferred model starts at $43,724 CAD, add the Trend Package for $4,000 CAD to get extra features like the 12.3\u201d digital driver display, wireless charger, a power driver\u2019s seat, dual pane sunroof, leatherette upholstery, power folding second row seats and 20\u201d wheels. A black interior is the only option available.\nIn Canada, there is no top 2024 Hyundai Santa Fe hybrid trim unless you get the NHL Limited Edition hybrid, only 500 units will be produced and it\u2019s equivalent to the Calligraphy gas model. Customize it the way you like with your favourite NHL team including the door sills, team branded accessories, a white matte exterior, 20\u201d black wheels and a brown Nappa leather interior. I like the Vancouver Canucks but not that much\u2026. It\u2019s priced at $59,723 CAD. All Canadian pricing includes, Freight, PDI and Fees. \nIn the US, there are more 2024 Hyundai Santa Fe hybrid trims available, the FWD hybrid starts at $36,950 USD, Limited $43,850 USD and Calligraphy $47,000 USD.

The Tucson has been mostly unchanged since 2022 with only minor packaging changes and a few new safety features for 2024. With pricing being fairly similar between SEL and SEL Convenience, it is hard to argue with the value of the SEL Convenience as long as you are ok with leather seats. Pricing between the SEL Convenience and Limited is greater but the Limited is the only way to get certain features for 2024.

        "description": "The Top 10 BEST Hybrid SUVs In 2024!\n\nPlush comfort, punchy acceleration, good cargo space, impressive towing capacity and great fuel efficiency - how do you get all these in one car? You get a Hybrid SUV. \n\nIn no particular order, here are our top 10 picks for 2024\u2026.\n\n1. Honda CR-V Hybrid - best for families\nThe Honda CR-V stands out as a top-performing compact crossover SUV, known for its versatile space, enjoyable driving experience, and efficient hybrid options. \nDiving into specifics, the CR-V's Sport and Sport Touring are the trims you need to choose from if you want the Hybrid CR-V. The hybrid powertrain combines a 2.0-liter four-cylinder engine with two electric motors, delivering 204 horsepower. The Sport variant comes with front-wheel drive as standard, but you can upgrade it to all-wheel drive. The Sport Touring is only all-wheel drive. Moreover, this variant accelerates to 60 mph in 7.9 seconds, almost half a second faster than its non-hybrid counterpart. \nAll CR-V models come equipped with hill-descent control for safe navigation on steep or slippery surfaces. Wheel sizes vary across trims, with most models sporting 18-inch wheels, and the Sport Touring featuring exclusive 19-inch black wheels. \nFuel efficiency shines in the front-wheel-drive Sport Hybrid, boasting 43 mpg in the city and 36 mpg on the highway. During real-world testing on the highway, at 75 mph, the Sport Touring Hybrid recorded 31 mpg.\nInside, the CR-V impresses with its elegant design. The dashboard features a honeycomb texture that cleverly conceals the air vents. Moreover, the Sport Touring trim includes a 9.0-inch touchscreen with wireless connectivity for Apple CarPlay and Android Auto, while other models have a standard 7.0-inch screen. Other notable interior features include a volume knob, built-in navigation, USB-C ports, wireless smartphone charging, and an optional 12-speaker Bose sound system in the Sport Touring trim. \nComfort is key in the CR-V, with front seats designed to minimize fatigue during long drives. In terms of space, the spacious interior includes a large center console bin, reclining back seats with increased legroom, and plenty of cargo space. \nThe Honda CR-V Sport Hybrid starts from $35k. The Sport-L Hybrid and Sport Touring Hybrid trims are a little pricier, starting from $38k and $41k, respectively. \n\n2. Kia Sportage Hybrid - best efficiency\nThe Kia Sportage Hybrid is a standout in the compact hybrid SUV category, excelling in ride quality, spacious interiors, and advanced technology. Its hybrid powertrain, featuring a turbocharged 1.6-liter engine and an electric motor, delivers 227 horsepower, surpassing rivals like the CR-V and RAV4 Hybrids. The front-wheel-drive version achieves an impressive 43 mpg combined, with the all-wheel-drive model at 38 mpg. Acceleration is good also, hitting 60 mph in 7.3 seconds.\nInside, the Sportage Hybrid boasts a modern aesthetic, highlighted by an optional 12.3-inch digital instrument panel and touchscreen display, housed together for a seamless look. Standard features include Android Auto, Apple CarPlay, various USB ports, and options like wireless charging and a surround-view camera. \nDriver aids like GPS-based adaptive cruise control, blind-spot monitoring, and parking assist are available, along with the Smart Park feature. The GPS-based cruise control is really interesting, as it uses GPS data to adjust speed based on the road, so it can slow down before curves and accelerate in a straight line. The Smart Park feature also works really well, and it can pull the car out of a parking spot from the key fob. \nIn its segment, the Sportage Hybrid competes with the likes of the RAV4 Hybrid, CR-V Hybrid, Escape Hybrid, and Tucson Hybrid. It excels in providing a quiet, comfortable cabin and a refined ride. The front seats are soft with good lateral support, and the rear seats, while somewhat flat, are well-padded, and offer a class-leading legroom of 41.3 inches. \nThe Sportage Hybrid's interior is pretty smart about storage also. You've got this cool center console, and the cup holders are a neat trick. They can slide away to make extra space and pop right back out when you need them, all with just a press of a button. It's super handy, especially if you're the type who likes to drop your phone or sunglasses in the cup holder.\nOverall, the Kia Sportage Hybrid, available in front-wheel and all-wheel-drive configurations, is a strong contender in its class, noted for its fuel efficiency, space, good price and wealth of technology and safety features.\nIn terms of price, the 2024 Kia Sportage Hybrid starts at nearly $30k and can go all the way up to $45k. \n\n#2024hybridSUVs #SUVs #Besthybrids",

        "description": "2024 Toyota Stout: The Game-Changer in Hybrid Pickups! \n\nToyota is setting the automotive world ablaze with the 2024 Stout - a compact, hybrid pickup that's gearing up to be Ford's worst nightmare! This game-changing vehicle comes equipped with a hybrid powertrain, unmatched ground clearance, and a groundbreaking feature poised to save buyers big bucks. In the next 10 minutes, we're diving deep into the Stout's specs, release, and pricing, thanks to Toyota's visionary CEO, Koji Sato.\n\nIs the Stout, a legend reborn? Rumors are flying that it's set to eclipse Ford's Maverick, fueled by Toyota's latest strategic moves. The Stout, a powerhouse since 1954, disappeared in the '90s but is now poised for a dramatic comeback, eyeing a market niche long dominated by Ford and GM.\n\nWe've snagged three juicy leaks about this comeback. First, Toyota's trademark revival for the Stout has set tongues wagging about its return. Next, insiders from AutoWeb in September 2022 hinted at Toyota's plans, with Jack Hollis of Toyota North America adding fuel to the fire. And finally, Ford execs themselves, in a MotorTrend interview, tipped their hats to Toyota's possible compact pickup invasion, recognizing the Maverick's success but acknowledging the looming competition.\n\nBut Ford's current woes could be Toyota's golden ticket. With the aging Tacoma and Tundra facing off against giants like the F-150 and Chevy Silverado, Toyota's looking to shake things up with the Stout \u2013 an attractively priced contender in the midsize SUV battle.\n\nWhat's the scoop on the Stout's price? Stay tuned as we delve into the juicy details. The original Stout was a beast with its 85 BHP, and the new model promises an even smoother ride, marrying its historic name with Toyota's modern innovation.\n\nBut wait, there's more \u2013 the transmission. Remember that mind-blowing feature we mentioned? It's all about fuel economy like you've never seen in a gas-powered car. Toyota's revamped transmission promises effortless movement and astounding mileage. But that's not all \u2013 the Stout might borrow some high-tech DNA from siblings like the Camry and RAV4, with hybrid tech borrowed from the likes of the Tacoma and Highlander.\n\nToyota's keeping mum on the specifics, much like a grandmother guarding her cookie recipe. Will it pack the RAV4's 2.5-liter engine, or the Highlander's new turbocharged powerhouse? Or, dare we hope, a fully electric version? \n\nWhen you step into the Toyota Stout, you'll be wowed by its spacious, innovative interior. Think dual cab comfort, a user-friendly infotainment system, and a design that screams sophistication. And with potential features like a colored heads-up display and digital rearview mirror, Toyota's pulling out all the stops.\n\nBut here's the big question: the price. The Stout is poised to be a market disruptor, likely priced below the Tacoma. With the Ford Maverick setting the bar high, Toyota knows it has to play its cards right to win big in this segment.\n\nSo, are you ready for a sub-$25,000 Stout with hybrid efficiency and Toyota's legendary reliability? Could this be the dawn of a new era in compact pickups? Drop your thoughts below, and don't forget to subscribe for more explosive automotive updates. Thanks for sticking with us \u2013 see you in the next one!\n\n#toyota #corolla #toyotacorolla #cars #2024 #Toyota2024 #NewCarReveal #AutomotiveFuture #InnovationUnveiled #ToyotaRevival #DriveIntoTheFuture",
